                                    <h3>Chapter 2334: Heaven Turning Flag</h3><p>"The final three auction items are truly extremely precious. Otherwise, I definitely wouldn't have dared to suggest to Master Ming to invite you out of seclusion," Hu Yushuang replied in a respectful manner.</p><p>"It's alright, a short delay like this won't hamper our cultivation. There's no need to attend to us any further; go ahead and continue the auction," the thin elderly said with a smile, while the other three stood beside him in silence.</p><p>"Please wait for me for a moment, esteemed elders; I'll conclude the auction as soon as possible," Hu Yushuang said before waving a hand toward the three women, and they immediately made their way to around 10 feet away from her before stopping again.</p><p>Meanwhile, the four elders made their way over to the four corners of the stone platform in a flash before taking a seat with their legs crossed.</p><p>All of the auction attendees were quite stunned that the He Lian Trade Guild had brought in four Grand Ascension Stage beings to oversee the final part of this auction; it seemed that the final three auction items were indeed extremely precious. </p><p>At this moment, Hu Yushuang made a hand seal, and the light barrier above one of the silver platters abruptly vanished, revealing a small grey flag.</p><p>The flag was only around half a foot in length and was completely dull and devoid of luster. Aside from a few yellow spirit patterns etched on its surface, it was completely unremarkable.</p><p>However, there were seven or eight faint silver talismans plastered all over the flag's surface, yet it was still giving off peculiar energy fluctuations that was blurring the surrounding space.</p><p>"I'm sure you've all heard of the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll. The roll is a list of all of the most powerful treasures in this realm; perhaps some of you are in possession of some of the spirit treasures ranked lower down on the roll. However, I'm sure not many of you have witnessed the Profound Heavenly Treasures at the top of the roll," Hu Yushuang said with a seductive smile as she cast her gaze across the plaza.</p><p>"Are you implying that there are Profound Heavenly Treasures among the final three auction items?" a Body Integration Stage being couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Hehe, that's right! The item that I'm holding right now is a Profound Heavenly Treasures; it's the Heaven Turning Flag, which is ranked ninth on the CHaotic Myriad Spirit Roll," Hu Yushuang declared as she raised the small flag in her hand.</p><p>"What? That's the Heaven Turning Flag?"</p><p>"How is that possible? That Profound Heavenly Treasure disappeared countless years ago!"</p><p>"At the time, seven or eight major races on the Tian Yuan Continent were severely damaged in a battle over this treasure, and two smaller races were wiped out altogether! I never thought this treasure would appear again." Excited chatter immediately rang out across the entire plaza, and even the Grand Ascension Stage beings in the silver cabins were quite stunned to hear this. </p><p>"I've also heard of the Heaven Turning Flag, but never did I think it would appear in an auction like this; as expected of a superpower like the He Lian Trade Guild," Han Li mused with a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>As for the blood soul and Zhu Guo'er, their eyes were already wide with incredulity.</p><p>"May I ask if that really is the Profound Heavenly Treasure on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll? If that really were the case, wouldn't your trade guild have hidden it away? Surely there's no way you would auction off such a precious treasure," the Grand Ascension Stage being who had bid for the Golden Lightning Lion marrow interrogated in a cold voice.</p><p>"You're correct, Senior. If this really were the very same treasure on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll, then there's no way our trade guild would dare to bring it out in such a blatant manner. Setting everything else aside, if several true spirit beings were to come after the treasure, our guild would be in immense trouble. However, I wasn't lying when I said that this was the Heaven Turning Flag on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll," Hu Yushuang replied with a slight bow. </p><p>"Oh? It sounds like this is quite an interesting treasure. Go ahead and elaborate on what you mean," another Grand Ascension Stage being prompted.</p><p>"Yes, Senior; I'll provide an explanation right away. Most of you have heard of the Heaven Turning Flag, so I'm sure you know that it only appeared for a very brief period of time in history. However, I'm sure that not many of you are aware that this flag actually split up into two: a Yin flag, and a Yang flag. The flag I'm holding now is the Yin flag, and if this treasure were to be used on its own, it would be comparable to a normal Divine Spirit Treasure in power; only when both flags are united can it unleash the full power of a Profound Heavenly Treasure. Otherwise, our guild wouldn't be selling it in this auction," Hu Yushuang explained.</p><p>"The Heaven Turning Flag split up into two?"</p><p>This revelation naturally sent another stir running throughout the venue, and many of the attendees were enlightened upon hearing this.</p><p>"I see, so this is only half of the Heaven Turning Flag. However, all Profound Heavenly Treasures possess immense spiritual nature; now that the Yin flag has appeared, the corresponding Yang flag should've emerged as well. Would your guild happen to have any information about the Yang flag?" another Grand Ascension Stage being asked.</p><p>Everyone immediately turned to Hu Yushuang to hear her answer; it was clear that this was something that all of them had wanted to ask.</p><p>"If our guild were aware of the Yang flag's whereabouts, we would've already obtained it rather than being forced to sell this Yin flag independently. Even this Yin flag was something that our guild had unintentionally come across. As for the Yang flag, I'm afraid we have no information on it at all. Alright, I've said everything there is to be said about this treasure; I'll be displaying some of its power now. Even though it doesn't possess the might of a Profound Heavenly Treasure, I'm sure this demonstration will be sufficient for all of you to verify its authenticity," Hu Yushuang replied before grabbing onto the flag and waving it through the air.</p><p>A loud buzzing sound immediately rang out from the small flag, following which bursts of yellow light were released, transforming into countless small yellow flowers that instantly inundated the entire stone platform.</p><p>In the next instant, Hu Yushuang began to chant an incantation, and all of the yellow flowers began to revolve around her.</p><p>All of the world's origin Qi in this entire space shuddered before surging toward the stone platform in a frenzy, then disappeared into the yellow flowers.</p><p>All of the yellow flowers began to radiate bright spiritual light while expanding drastically in size before beginning to drift and spread over the sky above the entire plaza.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the air above the plaza had transformed into a world of giant yellow flowers.</p><p>The foreign beings down below swept their spiritual sense up toward the yellow flowers, upon which their expressions immediately changed slightly.</p><p>All of them could sense the fearsome power imbued within the giant yellow flowers, and what was even more alarming was that these flowers seemed to be extremely internally unstable, as if they could explode at any moment.</p><p>However, right at this moment, a cold harrumph rang out from one of the flying cabins. "There's no need to continue this demonstration; do you think we can't tell if this is a Profound Heavenly Treasure or not? Hurry up and begin the auction!"As soon as the voice trailed off, a gust of fierce azure wind swept out of the silver cabin, eradicating most of the giant yellow flowers above the plaza in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"Yes, Senior; I'll begin right away!" Hu Yushuang's heart jolted upon seeing this, and she hurriedly waved the flag through the air again, releasing a burst of energy fluctuations that withdrew the rest of the yellow flowers. </p><p>"The base price of the Heaven Turning Flag's Yin flag is 300,000,000 spirit stones; let the bidding begin! If you don't have enough spirit stones, trading in treasures for discounts is permitted," Hu Yushuang declared as the small flag in her hand returned to its original dull and lusterless appearance.</p><p>"500,000,000!"</p><p>As soon as her voice trailed off, the Grand Ascension Stage being who had spoken earlier immediately made a bid.</p><p>All of the Body Integration and Spatial Tempering Stage beings on the plaza were rendered speechless upon hearing this.</p><p>500,000,000 spirit stones was far beyond what they could afford.</p><p>It seemed that the final auction items would all be taken by the Grand Ascension Stage beings, as had been the case during all of the past auctions.</p><p>However, the Spirit Realm had always been a place where power reigned supreme; they couldn't compare with those Grand Ascension Stage beings in power or wealth, so they naturally didn't dare to display any dissatisfaction.</p><p>"You're dreaming if you think you can purchase a Profound Heavenly Treasure for just 500,000,000 spirit stones. I'll take it for 800,000,000!" a female Grand Ascension Stage being in another flying cabin chuckled.</p><p>"Hmph, the complete Heaven Turning Treasure would be a priceless treasure that couldn't be bought no matter how many spirit stones you have, but it's only half a flag that's comparable to a Divine Spirit Treasure in power; the price I gave was already quite high. If you think this is worth more than that, then you can have it," the first Grand Ascension Stage bidder harrumphed coldly.</p><p>All of the other flying cabins remained silent, and no further bids were made. Perhaps they had been swayed by the words of that Grand Ascension Stage being, or they were concerned about something else.</p><p>The second bidder paid no heed to this as she said to Hu Yushuang, "Junior Hu, no one else is making any bids, so shouldn't you declare me as the new owner of this treasure?"</p><p>Hu Yushuang's heart jolted slightly upon hearing this, and she forced a fawning smile onto her own face as she replied, "Yes, Senior; I'll begin the count of three right away. If no one..."</p><p>However, before she had a chance to finish her sentence, a bid of 900,000,000 was suddenly made.</p><p>Both the blood soul and Zhu Guo'er turned to Han Li with surprised expressions as he was the one who had made the bid.</p><p>"950,000,000!"</p><p>"1,000,000,000!"</p><p>"1,300,000,000!"</p><p>The entire plaza fell silent once again.</p><p>

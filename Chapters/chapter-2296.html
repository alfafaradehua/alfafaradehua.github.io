                                    <h3>Chapter 2296: Space-time Power</h3><p>All of a sudden, her hand changed directions and was thrust toward the Nascent Soul's head.</p><p>"Don't you dare!"</p><p>The Nascent Soul reacted quite quickly, abruptly vanishing into thin air.</p><p>However, Ying'er merely plunged her hand into space as well before tugging viciously, and as she withdrew her hand again, a miniature figure that was bound by countless crimson threads was revealed in her grasp.</p><p>This was none other than the brocade-robed man's Nascent Soul, but it was completely immobilized, and it exclaimed with a stunned expression, "This is the law of space-time! You've managed to combine the power of laws of space and time into one!"</p><p>"I had already accomplished this over 100 years ago, but I couldn't display it due to my lackluster cultivation base. However, with your Nascent Soul, I should be able to make use of this power," Ying'er giggled as she flipped her other hand over to produce a small crimson flag.</p><p>The Nascent Soul was petrified at the sight of the crimson flag, and it hurriedly yelled, "That's the Soul Drawing Flag! Fellow Daoist Luo, hurry up and stop your daughter! Has she gone insane? Without me, you won't even be able to defeat these enemies, let alone refine the spatial power from the cores of the Space Fish beings!" </p><p>The green-robed woman had already noticed what was happening, and she was also very alarmed.</p><p>She immediately retreated to disengage herself from Xue Ran and Hei Lin, then released several treasures to buy herself some time while she hurriedly transmitted her voice toward Ying'er.</p><p>"What are you doing, Ying'er? Now's not the time to be fighting among ourselves! Release Fellow Daoist Yi and recover his physical body; our top priority right now is to take care of these enemies."</p><p>"Rest assured, Mother, I've already learned the method to extract spatial power from that disciple of his. As for these enemies, I have a way to take care of them," Ying'er replied in a nonchalant manner, then pointed a finger toward the bound Nascent Soul with a faint smile.</p><p>Crimson light flashed from her fingertip, and a burst of peculiar restriction fluctuations immediately surged through the air.</p><p>As a result, the Nascent Soul was completely numbed, and it could do anything aside from glower at Ying'er with a resentful expression.</p><p>Han Li was also quite astonished to hear the term "space-time power", but as he witnessed what Ying'er was doing next, a cold smile suddenly appeared on his face as he withdrew his Nascent Soul, then waved a hand toward his Provenance Golden Body, preparing to attack the restriction around the stone city again.</p><p>However, right at this moment, Ying'er cast a glance toward him before communicating something to him through voice transmission.</p><p>Han Li's expression changed slightly upon hearing what she had to say, and he suddenly made a hand seal, reverting back to his human form amid a flash of golden light.</p><p>After that, the Provenance Golden Body fused back into his body as well.</p><p>A pleased smile appeared on Ying'er's face upon seeing this, and she tossed the small crimson flag forward, following which it immediately rose up as a ball of crimson light.</p><p>She then chanted an incantation, and all of the remaining wolf-headed beasts around her exploded before vanishing into the flag as clouds of crimson mist.</p><p>In the next instant, the flag swelled to around 10 feet in size, while a sinister ghostly face appeared on its surface.</p><p>The ghostly face had countless twisted horns on its head, and one side of its face belonged to a hideous man, while the other half depicted a gorgeous woman.</p><p>It cackled in a bone-chilling manner, then opened its mouth to expel a burst of crimson light, which instantly swept up the Nascent Soul in Ying'er's hand.</p><p>As soon as the ghostly face surfaced on the flag, a despairing look appeared in the Nascent Soul's eyes, and it turned to Ying'er with an imploring expression.</p><p>However, after a flash of crimson light, the Nascent Soul quickly fell unconscious before being devoured by the ghostly face.</p><p>After that, Ying'er made a string of hand seals before pointing a finger at the flag a few times, following which the ghostly face vanished, and the flag reverted back to its original size before being swallowed by her.</p><p>Ying'er then turned to Han Li with a pleased nod before calling out to the green-robed woman. "Success! There's no need to fight them any longer, Mother; we can negotiate with these fellow daoists now."</p><p>The green-robed woman's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and she immediately descended toward the stone city as she said, "Alright, let me see how you're going to negotiate with these outsiders."</p><p>Xue Ran and Hei Lin naturally weren't willing to let her go, and they immediately set off in hot pursuit.</p><p>However, Han Li's voice also rang out at this moment. "Hold on, fellow daoists; let's hear what Fellow Daoist Ying has to say first."</p><p>Xue Ran faltered slightly upon hearing this. "What do you mean by that, Brother Han?"</p><p>Following Han Li's display of incredible power, the two foreign Grand Ascension Stage beings had become very wary of Han Li and didn't dare to disregard his opinion.</p><p>"It seems that this Fellow Daoist Ying is willing to give us some cores. In that case, there's naturally no need to continue fighting," Han Li replied in a calm manner.</p><p>"Is that true? She isn't just stalling for time, is she?" Xue Ran asked.</p><p>"If that's the case, then we'll just have to resume the battle. Even if she is stalling for time, it's not like she'll be able to stall us for long," Han Li replied.</p><p>After a quick discussion through voice transmission, Xue Ran and Hei Lin finally nodded in agreement. "In that case, let's go and hear what Fellow Daoist Ying has to say."</p><p>The main reason behind their willingness to accept this arrangement was their inability to gain the upper hand in the battle against the green-robed woman.</p><p>Thus, the two of them flew toward Han Li.</p><p>As for the Mo Jianli, he was too far away, so Han Li didn't immediately send him a message as doing so would result in too much of a delay.</p><p>Around a dozen streaks of light flew out of the stone city before landing on the city wall, heralding the arrival of the Body Integration Stage Asura Spiders.</p><p>Xue Ran and Hei Lin were quite relieved to see this.</p><p>The fact that the Asura Spiders operating the restrictions within the stone city had come out indicated that they really did want to negotiate.</p><p>The green-robed woman appeared beside Ying'er in a flash, then cast a peculiar gaze toward her before heaving a faint sigh.</p><p>"Seeing as Fellow Daoist Yi is already dead and you're determined to negotiate with these outsiders, I won't stop you, but you'll have to give me an explanation for all of this."</p><p>"Rest assured, Mother, I'll be sure to offer you a satisfactory explanation," Ying'er replied in a relaxed manner.</p><p>"You seem quite confident in your ability to deal with these people, so I'll leave the rest to you," the green-robed woman said with a complex expression.</p><p>Ying'er gave an affirmative response with a faint smile, then rose up into the air as a streak of crimson light, flying out of the light barrier over the stone city, seemingly completely unfazed by the fact that she was facing three Grand Ascension Stage beings.</p><p>Xue Ran and Hei Lin exchanged a slightly befuddled glance upon seeing this, while Han Li said in a calm voice, "You sure are courageous to be facing us so calmly at only the Body Integration Stage."</p><p>"I wouldn't be doing this if I were afraid of the three of you. It would naturally be very far-fetched for me to say that I contend with the three of you on my own, but if I were determined to escape, I'm sure you won't be able to stop me," Ying'er replied with a hint of a smile on her face.</p><p>"What insolence!" A cold look flashed through Hei Lin's eyes, and he seemed to be preparing to lash out again.</p><p>Han Li's brows furrowed slightly as he said, "She may sound quite arrogant, but she's right. She's combined the laws of space and time to create power of laws of the highest caliber, so even though her cultivation base is far inferior to ours, it'll essentially be impossible for us to defeat her."</p><p>"She's mastered the law of space-time? Aren't Asura Spiders only able to use the power of time? How did she attain spatial powers as well and combine the two into one?" Xue Ran exclaimed upon hearing this.</p><p>

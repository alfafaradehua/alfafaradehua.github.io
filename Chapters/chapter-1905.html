                                    <p>Not only were these bricks remarkably huge, they were all as smooth and lustrous as jade, clearly having been specially refined.</p><p>After they blocked the opening in the city wall, the cultivators up above immediately cast incantation seals toward them, and they immediately fused with the rest of the city wall in a seamless manner.</p><p>In the instant that the opening in the city wall vanished, the surfaces of several giant buildings in Heavenlean suddenly blurred, following which countless runes emerged from them.</p><p>These runes swirled through the air before forming a series of profound formations of different sizes, and immediately thereafter, these buildings transformed into giant stone puppets amid a string of rumbling booms.</p><p>Each puppet was completely devoid of facial features aside from a huge single eye, and there was a house-sized opening on each of their bellies. </p><p>Within each of those openings were several human cultivators standing on a heptagram, holding strange treasures with nervous looks on their faces.</p><p>These giants abruptly threw their heads back and let loose thunderous roars, then immediately rushed over to the city wall before rubbing their hands together.</p><p>A gust of fierce glacial winds swept forth, and countless specks of blue light appeared within the glacial wind before converging toward their palms.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a series of translucent ice spears that resembled thousand-feet-long pillars appeared. The giant puppets grabbed onto the spears, then hurled them violently through the air, upon which they instantly vanished amid flashes of blue light.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted in the air above the giant rhinoceroses, and over 1,000 streaks of piercing blue light emerged out of thin air. These streaks of blue light then transformed into thousand-feet-long ice spears that pierced through the rhinoceroses' mountainous bodies before exploding violently.</p><p>Following their explosions, the spears transformed into clouds of blue mist that were several acres in size, sealing the severely wounded rhinoceroses into gargantuan ice statues. The yellow protective light barriers around their bodies had completely failed to protect them!</p><p>Loud thunderclaps then erupted as over 100 massive bolts of crimson lightning crashed down from above, piercing through the dense devilish Qi without any warning before shattering all of the gigantic ice statues.</p><p>All of the giant rhinoceroses were instantly slain on the spot, and even their souls hadn't managed to escape.</p><p>Within a set of secret chambers inside the bodies of these giant stone puppets, a group of Deity Transformation Stage human cultivators all released the items in their hands as relieved expressions appeared on their faces.</p><p>These items were a series of shimmering red talismans, upon which were inscribed countless golden and silver runes.</p><p>As soon as these talismans were released by the human cultivators, they immediately completely dimmed and disintegrated into plumes of smoke.</p><p>Almost at the exact same moment, the human warriors on the city wall had exhausted the powers of their weapons, and they quickly began to retreat back to the city.</p><p>They were replaced by groups of human cultivators wearing four-colored robes, and as soon as they arrived on the city wall, they summoned a series of shimmering treasures, which transformed into swathes of five-colored light that hurtled directly toward the oncoming army of low-grade devilish beasts.</p><p>All of the low-grade devilish beasts that came into contact with these swathes of light were instantly destroyed, and it was quite clear that these weapons were far more powerful than the weapons the human warriors had been using.</p><p>With so many cultivators attacking at once, they were able to conjure up an astonishing spectacle, even though there weren't many high-grade beings among their ranks.</p><p>Without the protection of the giant rhinoceroses, the low-grade devilish beasts were being wiped out at an alarming rate, and the devilish army was being severely dented. As a result, the All-encompassing Devilish Cavaliers behind the low-grade devilish beasts immediately spurred on the devilish cloud around them to more than double the speed of its advancement.</p><p>Following a command issued by a high-grade cultivator, who was the leader of all of the human cultivators on the city wall, everyone immediately directed their treasures away from the low-grade devilish beasts and aimed them toward the devilish cloud instead.</p><p>The treasures hurtled toward the devilish cloud like a series of shooting stars, and a few dull thumps rang out as the devilish cloud churned violently.</p><p>A series of massive black runes then surged out of the cloud in a frenzy before forming a giant black formation. Treasures rained down upon the formation like a torrential storm, but the formation merely tremored slightly before keeping all of the treasures at bay.</p><p>Right at this moment, the devilish cavaliers within the devilish cloud each raised a hand at the same time, conjuring up long blades that were several feet in length each before slashing them violently through the air.</p><p>Countless black blade projections swept out of the devilish cloud as streaks of black light, and resounding explosions echoed throughout the entire heavens.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of human treasures clashed with these blade projections before instantly being sliced into pieces, then disintegrated into specks of light of different colors. The entire sky was instantly illuminated by these colorful lights, and at the same time, the devilish cavaliers let loose loud roars as they hurled their long blades through the air.</p><p>The blades transformed into streaks of black light that vanished into the giant formation up above, and a series of giant black blades quickly re-emerged from the center of the formation amid erratic flashes of black light.</p><p>Each of the blades was several hundred feet in length, and they immediately swept forward before crashing viciously down toward the city wall up ahead.</p><p>Black light swirled around the giant blades, and blade projections that were over 10,000 feet in length hurtled directly toward the city wall, unleashing a devastatingly fearsome aura.</p><p>All of the human cultivators encompassed beneath this burst of terrifying spiritual pressure immediately flew into a blind panic, and many of them rose up into the air to flee the scene, but it was already too late.</p><p>The giant black blade projections swept through the air, reducing all of the human cultivators to shreds of mangled blood and flesh, and another massive section of the city wall was felled, creating a huge gap that was over 1,000 feet wide.</p><p>Over 10,000 cultivators had just been killed by that single attack alone, and all of the human cultivators on the city wall were extremely horrified to see this. Some of them gritted their teeth and continued to attack the devilish formation in the distance, while others hurriedly summoned defensive treasures as a prophylactic measure.</p><p>After unleashing that devastating barrage of attacks, the giant black blades at the center of the formation disintegrated into specks of black light, following which a bone-chilling cry rang out from that gargantuan devilish ark again.</p><p>Vicious looks appeared on the faces of all of the devilish cavaliers upon hearing this sound, and they roared as they abruptly spurred on their devilish steeds to carry them forward as rapid streaks of black light. The distance of several kilometers was covered by these devilish cavaliers in just a few flashes, and all of the attacks that they were struck by were repelled by the black light barriers that appeared over their suits of armor.</p><p>Only very few of the oncoming treasures managed to break through their defenses, but the number of devilish cavaliers that were felled by these treasures was simply negligible in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, 100,000 All-encompassing Devilish Cavaliers had reached the protective light barrier in front of the city wall, and they unleashed countless streaks of powerful black light with their weapons to attack the light barrier.</p><p>Meanwhile, their devilish steeds were also unleashing all types of abilities with some blasting pillars of flames out of their mouths, while others conjured up a series of giant wind blades, and some were even directly attacking the light barrier with their horns.</p><p>In the face of such an astonishing number of attacks, the protective light barrier was only able to last for the span of a few breaths before flashing erratically, looking as if it were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Just a single wave of attacks from these All-encompassing Devilish Cavaliers was threatening to breach the city's defenses, and the oncoming human treasures were completely ineffective against them.</p><p>As for the giant stone puppets in the city, they seemed to only be capable of unleashing that one attack, and they had reverted back to become giant buildings again thereafter.</p><p>However, a clear ringing sound suddenly erupted from one of the giant towers, immediately following which spatial fluctuations surged through the air nearby, and thousands of human cultivators suddenly emerged.</p><p>All of them wore grim expressions, and they quickly formed a massive formation with the giant tower at the very center. After that, they lowered their heads and raised a hand each as they began to chant incantations in unison.</p><p>Five-colored incantation seals formed by spiritual power surged into the massive tower as countless streaks of spiritual light, and a loud buzzing sound rang out from the tower as dazzling five-colored light appeared over its surface.</p><p>At the same time, violent tremors suddenly ran through a plot of empty land outside the city wall, and the ground abruptly split open to reveal a series of inky-black tunnels. Immediately thereafter, groups of copper humanoid figures that were each around 20 feet tall rushed out of the tunnels.</p><p>These copper humanoid figures were clad in thick and heavy suits of armor, and were wielding all types of weapons, including long halberds and powerful crossbows. Some of them were riding atop copper spirit beast steeds, while others were standing on azure war carriages that were over 100 feet in length each. These humanoid figures pounced toward the devilish cavaliers in a completely expressionless manner, and the devilish general in the giant ark seemed to be rather taken aback to see this, but he then harrumphed coldly before letting loose another piercing cry.</p><p>Ferocious looks immediately appeared in the eyes of the devilish cavaliers as they rushed toward the puppet army, and a fierce battle immediately ensued.</p><p>During this brief period of respite, a series of dazzling streaks of light appeared in the air above the city wall. These streaks of light then faded to reveal several thousand high-grade human cultivators, and they summoned countless treasures before also joining the battle.</p><p>Even though the army of copper puppets was clearly no match for the All-encompassing Devilish Cavaliers, the addition of the high-grade cultivators allowed them to hold their own. Furthermore, with the assistance from the desperate attacks being unleashed by the low-grade cultivators on the city wall, they were slowly gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Strangely enough, the devilish general in the giant ark didn't send the Jialun War Devils into battle despite this. Only after several hours had passed, when both the All-encompassing Devilish Cavaliers and the human army had suffered some casualties, did the dull chime of a bell suddenly ring out.</p><p>As soon as the devilish cavaliers heard this sound, they immediately began to retreat, forming a series of tight defensive formations as they did.</p><p>At the same time, the Jialun War Devils began to advance while appraising the human army with cold expressions.</p><p>

                                    <h3>Chapter 2419: Mythical Black Beasts</h3><p>Yang Deer's expression changed drastically upon hearing this, and he looked around to find that there was faint black Baleful Yin Qi stretching as far as the eyes could see.</p><p>On top of that, he discovered that he could only release his spiritual sense to encompass a radius of less than 10 kilometers.</p><p>"Don't worry, we had already anticipated that the powerful beings on this continent would try this. This plays right into my hands; once I brush these fools aside, no one in the entire Spirit Realm would dare to plot against me," Ma Liang said with a cold smile.</p><p>"Be careful, Master. According to my knowledge, the He Lian Trade Guild is extremely powerful, and if they were to make a last-ditch effort, they would definitely be able to bring out many formidable trump cards," Yang Deer cautioned.</p><p>"How could an organization in a lower realm possibly pose a threat to me? Even if they also knew the method to activate chains of laws, it would be useless on this occasion," Ma Liang scoffed in a nonchalant manner.</p><p>Yang Deer naturally didn't dare to say anything further upon seeing Ma Liang's confident display.</p><p>At this point, the river of blood and the flying boat had already entered deep into Baleful Cry Point.</p><p>All of a sudden, the flying boat abruptly blurred before vanishing mid-flight.</p><p>Ma Liang's pupils contracted slightly upon seeing this, and the entire river of blood also drew to a halt at his behest.</p><p>A wary look appeared on Yang Deer's face, and the suit of yellow armor immediately emerged over his body.</p><p>Right at this moment, bursts of loud rumbling rang out in all directions as clouds of black Baleful Yin Qi surged forth.</p><p>A series of flags also appeared in the surrounding area before instantly swelling to over 1,000 feet in size, surrounding the entire river of blood like a ring of giant trees.</p><p>At the same time, a round azure moon appeared in the sky, atop which stood around a dozen humanoid figures, all of whom were appraising the river of blood with grim expressions.</p><p>These were none other than the Grand Ascension Stage beings assembled by Ming Zun, and the Six-winged Frost Centipede and the Ice Phoenix were also among them.</p><p>Ma Liang's expression remained unchanged as he glanced at the giant flags, then suddenly thrust a palm toward a certain direction.</p><p>A resounding boom rang out as a massive crimson palm that was around an acre in size emerged from the river of blood before thrusting toward the same direction.</p><p>Five-colored light flashed from the giant flags, converging to form a massive five-colored light mirror.</p><p>The massive crimson palm struck the mirror before vanishing into it in complete silence.</p><p>At the same time, the giant palm appeared in a secluded corner of Baleful Cry Point before striking a plot of empty land in a vicious manner, creating a huge crater that was several kilometers in size amid an earth-shattering boom.</p><p>A hint of surprise appeared on Ma Liang's face upon seeing this. "Oh? This is spatial transference! This formation appears to be..."</p><p>Right at this moment, a burst of loud buzzing rang out from the giant flags, and a series of five-colored light mirrors were quickly conjured up.</p><p>Countless projections of humanoid figures, beasts, and buildings of all descriptions instantly appeared around the river of blood, striking the beholder with a sense of disorientation.</p><p>Ma Liang's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this, and he made a hand seal, upon which black and white Qi surged out of his back before also transforming into a black and white mirror.</p><p>Initially, the mirror was only around the size of a human palm, but it quickly swelled to the size of a washbasin at his behest, and a black and white tai chi diagram appeared on its surface. The diagram released a pillar of black and white light, a sharp tearing sound rang out as all of the five-colored light mirrors around the river of blood were torn apart by the pillar of black and white light before disintegrating into specks of spiritual light.</p><p>All of the Grand Ascension Stage beings' expressions changed slightly upon seeing this, and the Yin Gangzu turned to Ming Zun before asking, "Brother Ming, you've been full of praise for this Bipolar Annihilation Formation; why is it that its power been dispelled by such a casual strike?"</p><p>"Hmph, a casual strike? If I'm not mistaken, that black and white mirror is most likely a treasure no less powerful than Profound Heavenly Treasures. Otherwise, do you really think a normal attack could break those illusions so easily? Having said that, if he thinks that this is all it'll take to break this formation, then he couldn't be more wrong," Ming Zun harrumphed coldly.</p><p>"Is that so?" Yin Gangzi seemed to be rather skeptical, as was everyone else.</p><p>As if to support Ming Zun's statement, right after the five-colored light mirrors were destroyed by the black pillar of light, a series of tiny white runes suddenly appeared near the river of blood.</p><p>Initially, the runes were quite sparse, but in the blink of an eye, they were falling from the heavens like a dense snowstorm.</p><p>At the same time, a burst of power of laws encompassed the entire river of blood.</p><p>Inside the river of blood, Ma Liang was struck by a chilling sensation, and the air around him suddenly became more viscous.</p><p>His expression changed slightly as he hurriedly tried to draw upon his own magic power, only to find that around a third of it had become sluggish and inaccessible.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yang Deer was faring even worse. In the instant that the power of laws had acted it, it felt as if its body had become as heavy as a mountain, and it was horrified to find that most of its magic power became inaccessible.</p><p>"As expected, this really must be an immortal formation to be able to affect even me. It's quite impressive that you were able to set up such a formation in a lower realm. Unfortunately for you, the formation is incomplete, and it won't be too difficult for me to break it," Ma Liang said with a cold smile.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, he opened his mouth to release a small green umbrella, which he pointed a finger at, and the umbrella immediately rose up into the air, then swelled to around half a kilometer in size before slowly opening.</p><p>A green light barrier then descended from the giant green umbrella, encompassing the entire river of blood beneath it.</p><p>The impact of the power of laws in the area was instantly severely diminished, and Yang Deer immediately recovered its mobility, as well as access to most of its magic power.</p><p>As for Ma Liang, he seemed to have become entirely unaffected as he stomped a foot down onto the blood dragon beneath him.</p><p>A thunderous chorus of dragon's roars rang out, and the eight blood dragons within the river of blood flew out in unison before pouncing directly toward Ming Zun and the others. </p><p>All of them had thick bolts of silver lightning surging over their bodies, and they were giving off formidable Grand Ascension Stage auras.</p><p>"We have to act now! He has to withstand the power of formation while unleashing that river of blood to oppose us, and he definitely won't be able to keep this up for long. I'll also summon the four true spirits to assist us," Ming Zun yelled as he made a grabbing motion to summon a reddish-purple badge, which he immediately tossed forward.</p><p>A burst of loud rumbling rang out as the badge transformed into a huge reddish-purple rune.</p><p>All of a sudden, spatial fluctuations erupted at four locations around the river of blood, and four black platforms emerged, atop each of which was a fearsome-looking black beasts.</p><p>The four beasts were identical in appearance; all of them were over 100 feet in length with lion bodies and dragon heads.</p><p>As soon as the platforms appeared, the four beasts opened their eyes and stood up in unison before letting loose ferocious roars.</p><p>"You had four Mythical Black Beasts up your sleeve? Haha, you sure are good at keeping secrets, Brother Ming. With their assistance, our victory is all but guaranteed," Yin Gangzi said in an elated manner, and the others were also ecstatic to see these four beasts.</p><p>Mythical Black Beasts were top-tier true spirits that ranked near the likes of heavenly dragons and true phoenixes; they weren't inferior even to the qilins of all elements. As such, the sudden appearance of four of these beasts naturally instilled everyone with immense confidence.</p><p>The Mythical Black Beasts sprang up into the air before pouncing toward the river of blood as gusts of black wind, and they were immediately followed by the Grand Ascension Stage beings, who unleashed various abilities and treasures to attack the eight blood dragons down below.</p><p>Lights of all different colors flashed in the sky, clashing with the river of blood to create a string of devastating explosions.</p><p>As soon as the Mythical Black Beasts drew close to the river of blood, a cold smile appeared on Ma Liang's face as he made a hand seal, and gusts of Yin winds surged out of the river of blood, following which four massive crimson giants were manifested.</p><p>The four giants were over 1,000 feet tall and completely bald, wearing suits of armor that were of the same color as their bodies.</p><p>They raised their fists before launching them toward the Mythical Black Beasts, and even before their fists had even struck their targets, a nauseating odor of blood and gore was already sweeping through the air.</p><p>The four Mythical Black Beasts were able to evade the attacks before instantly appearing behind the crimson giants, then gently swept their front limbs through the air to release long black blade projections, and the four giants were immediately decapitated.</p><p>As for the Mythical Black Beasts, they continued onward without pause, preparing to plunge straight into the river of blood.</p><p>Right at this moment, Ma Liang uttered the word "restrict", and the four Mythical Black Beasts felt as if explosions had rung out in their heads, causing them to falter involuntarily.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, around a dozen crimson tentacles swept toward them from behind before striking them like lightning.</p><p>Most of the black Qi around the four beasts was scattered, and they were sent flying for hundreds of feet amid cries of surprise while scorching crimson flames were ignited on their bodies.</p><p>In the next instant, a string of furious roars rang out, and eight tornadoes erupted into the heavens, sweeping all of the crimson flames away to reveal the black beasts again, which had swelled to several times their original size.</p><p>Not far behind the massive beasts, the four crimson giants had regenerated their lost heads, and they were appraising the four huge black beasts with expressionless eyes, while violently flailing crimson tentacles had emerged from their backs.</p><p>

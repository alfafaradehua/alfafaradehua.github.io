<p>Chapter 1095: Demon Flocking

The grey-robed old man worriedly said, "If it were only the old demon's incarnation, we might stand a chance of winning. We've fully released glacial Qi from the island's restriction and blocked a majority of ordinary demon beasts from entering. Only ice-attributed demon beasts will be immune from the restriction."

"It is no matter," the beautiful woman said, "The Ice Sea demon beasts will be dealt with using the treasures our ancestors have left behind. After all, the treasures were stored in our sect for countless years so that they would one day be used. We'll only need to take particular care of the demon beasts at grade nine and above."

Bai Yaoyi and the old man unconsciously exchanged a glance before wearing an understanding gaze.

The old man cracked a smile, "If Milady hadn't mentioned it, we would've nearly forgotten about the treasure. With that treasure, the Ice Sea demons will be useless. It is a pity it only works on their lower grade demon beasts, or else it would be a great killing tool."

"That will be enough. Against the overbearing number of demons, the odds of defending ourselves aren't great. Let us use this time to evacuate the lower-grade disciples and only have useful disciples stay behind. We'll be reducing meaningless deaths."

"Yes, milady!" Both Bai Yaoyi and the old man respectfully acknowledged.

In the following days, the quiet sect was stirred into action. A strained atmosphere from the upcoming war seemed to blossom overnight.

Not only were a majority of the sect's spell formation and restrictions activated, but there were masses of low-grade disciples evacuating from the sect. It was unknown where they went.

Two days after the three elders had their conversation, Arctic Dragon opened his eyes from meditation from within the Great Yang Essence Stone room down inside the Profound Jade Cave.

He looked at the other cultivators that were meditating in the room and slowly said, "I previously explained the crucial points and techniques needed. With your talents, two days should be more than enough for you to comprehend what to do."

With that said, the others began to slowly open their eyes.

The monk smiled, "No problems on my end."

"I've already finished learning it a half-day earlier!" The old woman boldly said.

"I am also done," said Han Li.

Bai Mengxin and the azure-robed middle-aged man already done this ahead of time of course.

"Since you're all ready, let's start! The process of breaking through my bottleneck can take anywhere to several days to many months. Regardless of the possibility of success, I hope you'll do your best until the end. In truth, I am somewhat worried about the circumstances on the outside, so I hope for this to finish as soon as possible!" Arctic Dragon spoke with a stiff expression.

Naturally, the others raised no objections.

Afterwards, Arctic Dragon and the palace elders took out bundles of formation flags and plates from their storage pouch and began to set them down in the cave, producing several wondrous spell formations.

Although Han Li and the others didn't need to take action, they didn't want to miss an opportunity to observe any secret techniques. With ice flames lit on their bodies, they left the room and observe the actions of the North Night Palace cultivators.

In the time it took to finish a cup of tea, the three palace elders finished placing down their formations.

There was three overlapping spell formation placed with the hill of stones at its center. They created an imposing atmosphere with talisman characters flickering in the air.

Arctic Dragon blurred, arriving midair and examining the spell formations. Then, he spun once around, flicking his fingers at the same time.

He dozed a dozen spell seals at the spell formations, creating a dozen clouds of smoke that disappeared as soon as they appeared.

The entire spell formation began to release low-pitched hums and brightly flicker. This seemed to agitate the Profound Jade glacial Qi that filled the cave, causing it to splatter like water in boiling oil.

As for the glacial Qi concentrated on the large boulder on the center of the hill, it seemed to unaffected.

Floating in the air, Arctic Dragon glanced around him and wore a satisfied expression, "Very good! The more Profound Jade glacial Qi may be better, but first, we'll need to stabilize it to increase the odds of success.

At that moment, Han Li's gaze dropped down to the hill of stones and saw the five pillars of light emerge from the spell formation with the huge boulder at their center.

The pillars each glowed purple, red, white, black, and yellow, taking form from pure spiritual power.

Threads of light continuously flowed in between each of the pillars, almost as if they were one whole entity.

As soon as he saw the formation activate, Han Li flew off in an azure streak towards the purple pillar.

Soon after, the light dimmed to reveal Han Li floating at the top of the pillar.

The other four elders followed suit, each of them flying to their own pillar. They then exchanged a glance with one another and sat down, Han Li included.

In accordance with the secret technique he was given, Han Li began to slowly circulate his magic power and summon the Purple Apex Flames around his body with gradually increasing brilliance.

Han Li suddenly shouted and formed a different hand gesture.

Suddenly, a ball of purple light appeared from beneath him and changed into the form of a three-meter-large lotus, delicate and beautiful.

Han Li continued, lighting the Purple Apex Flames from the lotus in an instant, and provoking it to grow a half larger.

Han Li's brow stirred in surprise when he saw this.

Arctic Dragon hadn't mentioned that the spell formations would raise the powers of the glacial flames to this degree, so it came as quite a surprise. If he could get his hands on the formation, it could prove very useful.

However, Han Li immediately noticed that as the Apex Purple Flames surged, the rate at which his magic power was consumed greatly increased.

There seemed to be a flaw in increasing the power of the glacial flames.

With that in mind, he looked at the cultivators on top of the other light pillars.

The cultivators had done the same, producing glowing nearly-identical lotuses beneath them. They were all sitting above them and experiencing an increase in the flame's might.

Han Li's gaze then shifted to the ball of glacial light floating near the cave walls.

The wisp of Great Yin Trueflame was concealed there as it slowly absorbed the surrounding Profound Jade glacial Qi. It had yet to be detected.

Fortunately, Spirit Void Hall has restrictions surrounding it, else he wouldn't have dared to release the flame as it was intelligent.

As Han Li still observed the Great Yin Trueflame, Arctic Dragon said, "It seems you've all cultivated a certain degree of control over your frost flames. You should be able to hold out for a while. I am quite relieved. Next, I will enter the center of the glacial Qi. Activate your glacial flames as was planned!"

After he said this, the Celestial Ice Flames surrounding his body stirred and slowly descended upon the ball of white glacial Qi.

A series of rumblings sounded and blue flames twinkled, followed by Arctic Dragon entering the ball.

Through some unknown method, the Celestial Ice Flames and the Profound Jade glacial Qi hadn't reacted upon contact, causing the ball of white light to appear as if it had emerged from Master Arctic Dragon's body, creating a rather jarring sight to behold.

At that moment, the azure-robed middle-aged man and Bai Mengxin flipped their hand, each producing a blue formation plate. They pressed the plate several times with practiced motions, causing the surrounding spell formations to create a barrier of rainbow light, enveloping all the cultivators present.

Soon after, gales raged outside the barrier, but it completely concealed it from view and silenced its howls.

In the other areas of the cave, their surging glacial Qi had slowly returned to normal with the appearance of the gusts.

The only thing out of place was a thread of scarlet flame hiding at the corner as it consumed the glacial light surround it.

As time slowly passed by, the gales continued to roar around the hill of stones with no other sounds apart from the wind's howling.

A week later, the demon beasts outside of North Night Island finally made their grand appearance. They were incoming from two directions, the mainland and the Ice Sea.

Demonic Qi and hostile intent drowned the air.

There were a few clans and small sects that resided nearby, but they were naturally scared and fled.

Against such a large oncoming force, North Night Palace immediately acquired information on it and at the same time, they immediately lifted the restrictions on the island's Heaven Essence Yin Vein, causing the temperatures to massively drop, flooding the island with harsh glacial Qi and snowstorms.

The demons from the mainland, mostly from Myriad Demon Valley, were already prepared. They had their low-grade demon beasts stationed on the outskirts of the island, waiting as the island's store of glacial Qi was exhausted. The tens of demon beasts that were above grade six entered the island in teams.

A majority of the demon beasts from the Ice Sea had no fear of the glacial Qi or storms of North Night Island, thus sending over a thousand demon beasts directly towards North Night Palace.

North Night Island wasn't very large, but when these demon beasts invaded, they seemed to disappear into the snowy landscape itself.

But the high-grade cultivators of the palace wouldn't allow the demons to tread as they pleased. Drawing support from their spell formations and island's glacial Qi, they immediately set off to kill the demon invaders.

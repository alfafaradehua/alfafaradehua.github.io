                                    <p>Chapter 1377: Appearance of Six Arms</p><p>In the wood spirit&rsquo;s fright, green light flashed from their bodies as they summoned wood armor, shields, or green mist to block the crimson threads.</p><p>But the crimson threads pierced through their defenses as if they were passing through air and burrowed into their bodies.</p><p>The wood spirits glowed crimson and were then captured in a crimson net, rendered incapable of moving.</p><p>At that same moment, the sword Qi that Han Li used to chop the ancient tree had turned into two faintly golden blurs, chopping towards the silver-tier wood spirit, Mu Rui.</p><p>Mu Rui coldly snorted and pointed at them.</p><p>Two silver lights flashed as they streaked forward to meet the golden blurs.</p><p>Muffled clangs sounded and the golden blurs ruptured in countless golden specks. The specks then covered Mu Rui.</p><p>Then as the ground roared, a spell formation made of golden talisman characters suddenly lit up around Mu Rui. Its radiant glow covered the high-grade wood spirits in balls of light.</p><p>The purple light in Mu Rui&rsquo;s eyes withdrew. He closed his hands together and balls of silver light appeared from his palms. Afterwards, countless silver streaks erupted.</p><p>A rumbling explosion sounded. Silver light and golden talisman characters intertwined. The golden talisman characters possessed some sort of odd ability that allowed them to block the strikes of the silver-tier wood spirit. Only a small portion of the talisman characters was dispersed.</p><p>Mu Rui felt furious at the sight of his attacks being ineffective.</p><p>Without another thought, silver light appeared from his hands and condensed balls of silver light that were even more dazzling than the last.</p><p>But at that moment, all of the wood spirits, Mu Rui included, were completely enveloped by the golden light. Although Han Li and Long Dong were astonished, they weren&rsquo;t about to continue a battle to the death. They each used their own life-saving measures to immediately fly away.</p><p>Xiao Hong clutched her hands in an incantation gesture and her body sank towards the ground, instantly turning into a beautiful phoenix wrapped in black flames. She charged at the army of wood apes and turned their bodies and weapons to ash as she brushed past them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the phoenix traveled over three hundred meters.</p><p>Long Dong&rsquo;s expression turned harsh and he swallowed a rainbow medicine pill. Soon after, he chanted an incantation and summoned a set of winged armor on his body.</p><p>The wing spread out and a golden dragon phantom appeared from the armor.</p><p>The dragon let loose a long cry and circled once around Long Dong before entering his body.</p><p>Soon after, golden light brightly shined from the blood-marked youth and he tore through the sky in a thirty-meter-long golden streak. The image of a soaring five-claw dragon could faintly be seen in the golden light. Anything that obstructed the light turned into a cloud of blood and gore.</p><p>Like their abrupt world-shaking speed, Han Li silently put his own technique into action. He unfolded a pair of azure and white wings in a clap of thunder.</p><p>He opened his mouth and spat out several crimson blood mists. They spiralled around his body before submerging his entire body in the blood mist.</p><p>The blood mist pulsed several times and shrunk, releasing a crimson streak. It blinked several times and appeared in the vast horizon, making his way past the wood ape beasts as if he were a host.</p><p>Then in another flash, Han Li&rsquo;s crimson figure disappeared once more.</p><p>At Deity Transformation stage, Han Li&rsquo;s Bloodshadow Evasion was several times quicker than even Long Dong&rsquo;s and Xiao Hong&rsquo;s movements.</p><p>When the two looked at Han Li, they couldn&#39;t help but be dumbstruck.</p><p>As for the young white-robed woman, she waved her hand and summoned a sparkling red broken blade. Without making any flashy movements, she simply waved the blade in the direction where the wood apes were the most concentrated.</p><p>All of the worldly essence Qi in the vicinity trembled and crimson blade light over three hundred meters long and leisurely traveled through the air.</p><p>The blade light inspired an uproar at the wood apes that were targetted. They all thought to flee in their terror.</p><p>But before the wood apes could flee, their bodies trembled and they combusted, instantly turning to bursts of red flame, soon turning to ash.</p><p>A clear path was now made where the apes had been.</p><p>Before the huge blade light touched anything, it had strangely disappeared.</p><p>At that moment, a fist-sized green flame bird shot out from the bottom portion of the damaged tree that hid the jade slip. It flew into the young woman&rsquo;s body in a green streak.</p><p>The white-robed young woman was overjoyed when she heard this. Her body disappeared in a blur. Then she appeared in the direction of the opened passage in a flash. Then, in another blur, she reappeared at the end of the cleared passage.</p><p>Afterwards, she turned into a white streak as she tore through the air. The flight light was indistinct, but over the span of a few breaths, she already made her way past the horizon.</p><p>The speed of her flight seemed no different than Han Li&rsquo;s Bloodshadow Evasion.</p><p>At that moment, Mu Rui&rsquo;s silver light suddenly burst forth from the formation of golden talisman characters.</p><p>The silver light was clearly more powerful than before. In a single strike, most of the golden talisman characters had scattered with only a remaining few revolving around him.</p><p>The wood spirit&rsquo;s face turned expressionless, but a purple light wildly flickered from his eyes. Suddenly, he raised his head and a series of clear screeches sounded.</p><p>At that moment, the wood ape beasts stirred and they immediately turned into several clouds, each chasing after one of the cultivators.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the distant areas of the other Black Leaves Forest, a similar screech was sounded.</p><p>Han Li hadn&rsquo;t used the Bloodshadow Evasion to travel far. Once he saw no more beasts in sight, he withdrew the crimson light and continued to fly as an azure streak.</p><p>Even so, his face had still become bloodlessly pale.</p><p>It appeared that two consecutive uses of the Bloodshadow Evasion took a heavy toll on his vitality.</p><p>But when he thought of the possibility of being pursued by silver-tier wood spirits, he didn&rsquo;t dare to be careless. Those wood spirits were equivalent to Body Integration-stage cultivators. Despite the confidence in his heaven-defying abilities, there was far too great a difference in their realms. He didn&rsquo;t dare to hope he could win, even if it was a lower silver-tier&nbsp;being.</p><p>Were it not for the hidden people who assisted them and used a secret technique to restrict the silver-tier&nbsp;wood spirit, he feared they wouldn&rsquo;t have had the opportunity to flee.</p><p>However, it was clear that the golden talisman restriction wouldn&rsquo;t hold them for long. Thus, they hurriedly fled. As it was possible any of them could be pursued by the silver grade wood spirit, he didn&rsquo;t dare to linger.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he couldn&#39;t use the Bloodshadow Evasion again, the Thunderstorm Wings on his back continued to flicker. With each flash, his speed abruptly increased. With a dozen more, his speed would be equivalent to a Spatial Tempering cultivator.</p><p>But even so, Han Li didn&rsquo;t dare to turn around and focused on moving forward as quickly as he could.</p><p>Winds tore from beneath him and soon after, several gales shot towards him at immense speed.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s expression sank and his flight came to a sudden stop.</p><p>Three azure light appeared from underneath him, each of them only a meter away from his body.</p><p>If Han Li hadn&rsquo;t stopped, he feared he would&rsquo;ve been skewered.</p><p>The three azure lights circled in the air and they turned into three wood tribe beings. All of them blocked his way forward.</p><p>Han Li swept his sights at the three and discovered they wore faint yellow belts at their waist and he felt relief.</p><p>They were only equivalent to Nascent Soul cultivators. He had no need to worry.</p><p>Unwilling to use his various treasures, he simply flapped his wings and he shot forward in azure-white lightning.</p><p>The speed of lightning was instantaneous. He arrived in front of the center wood spirit in a blur.</p><p>The wood spirit didn&rsquo;t show any emotion, but purple light quickly circled from its eyes. Then, it fearlessly stabbed its wood spear into Han Li&rsquo;s abdomen.</p><p>Before the spear touched him, countless azure thorns ruptured from it, wanting to turn Han Li into a pincushion.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s eyes godly glinted and golden light flashed from his hands, instantly covering his body in transparent golden scales. The azure thorns clanged and bounced off upon impact, leaving no damage.</p><p>Then, his arms strangely reached out and grabbed the tip spear. The wood spirit tried to pull it back with all its might, but the spear didn&rsquo;t move in the slightest.</p><p>Azure Qi lit up from the wood spirit&rsquo;s face and then it released the spear, quickly fleeing back like a shooting star.</p><p>However, Han Li&rsquo;s other hand suddenly burst forward as sharp cracks sounded from it. It instantly arrived at the wood spirit&rsquo;s chest and sank his fingers through like a sword.</p><p>A clear ring sounded. The wood spirit&rsquo;s body was torn like paper by Han Li&rsquo;s powerful strength. Then, he tore out a faint yellow crystal from the wood spirit&rsquo;s body.</p><p>This entire attack only took a single instant.</p><p>When the other two wood spirits saw this, they let out a strange screech. They spat out a yellow mist and waved their spears, creating countless phantoms to surround Han Li.</p><p>Han Li sneered and twisted his arms, wanting to use them to battle.</p><p>But something outside his expectations occurred.</p><p>With one hand in the wood spirit&rsquo;s body and the other grasping the spear, green light brightly shined from the wood spirit&rsquo;s body and he feels an inconceivable attractive force.</p><p>His hands blurred, and soon, he found he couldn&#39;t move them in the slightest.</p><p>In that slight delay, yellow mist instantly covered his face and countless phantoms released azure streaks at him.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s face strangely twisted and his lips moved as if he were about to say something.</p><p>Suddenly, golden light brightly shined from his body. Four indistinct golden arms suddenly appeared through the ribs of a few of the phantoms.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1376.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1378.html">Next</a></li>

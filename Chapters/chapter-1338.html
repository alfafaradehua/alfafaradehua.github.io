                                    <p>Chapter 1338: Soul Freezing into the Body</p><p>Under the gaze of so many people, Fairy Xu felt apprehension, nevertheless, she waved her sleeve and summoned a white light. It circled above her to reveal a crystalline flying sword.</p><p>It was her bonded magic treasure, the Ice Crystal Sword!</p><p>To tell the truth, she felt largely helpless.</p><p>Even if a trick was done to the Green Wave Sword, she was only given a little bit of time to refine the Myriad Year Profound Jade that was given to her into the sword. &nbsp;However, this still greatly increased the sword strength, so there was a chance to seal the blade in ice.</p><p>Although she released her sword, she didn&rsquo;t dare to immediately attack the green sword. Instead, she hesitantly glanced at Han Li.</p><p>Han Li took a glance at both of the flying swords and he reached out to one of the swords.</p><p>Fairy Xu felt her sword largely tremble. Then, it flew against her control and arrived in Han Li&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>He grabbed the sword&rsquo;s hilt and flicked his finger against its body, emitting a phoenix&rsquo;s cry.</p><p>The sound was extremely pleasant, a near heavenly tone.</p><p>The old man couldn&#39;t help but sneer.</p><p>Although cultivators of their level could use secret techniques to forcefully boost the might of their magic treasures, it was a difficult task to do this to another treasure.</p><p>After all, regardless of the nature of the spiritual power and technique will conflict and make it difficult to fuse together.</p><p>When he forcefully boosted the power of his disciple&rsquo;s magic treasure, he unexpectedly acquired an extremely profound spirit talisman. After spending half a month refining it, it finally became this powerful.</p><p>As Han Li was only an early Deity Transformation cultivator, he didn&rsquo;t believe that he could exceed that power in only an instant.</p><p>Furthermore, sealing the Green Wave Sword in ice was something that only equivalent ice-attributed power could perform. This in itself was a huge restriction.</p><p>As this quickly flashed through the old man&rsquo;s mind, he had no fear of Han Li&rsquo;s action.</p><p>&ldquo;A good sword!&rdquo; As if having seen through the old man&rsquo;s thoughts, the corner of Han Li&rsquo;s lip twitched and a silver flame burst out from the hilt of the sword. In the blink of an eye, it wrapped around the sword and disappeared into it.</p><p>The crystalline sword turned silver-white in the blink of an eye. The design of a sailing flame bird now appeared on its surface, lifelike in detail as if it had been carved there from the very beginning.</p><p>Han Li had used forcefully injected his Spirit Engulfing Flame into the Ice Crystal Sword, inducing this bizarre transformation.</p><p>The Spirit Engulfing Flame was an inconceivable ability that devoured spiritual power. As it was formed from Great Yin Trueflame and Puresun Flame Essence, it could shift between extreme cold and heat, allowing it to fuse into the flying sword with ease.</p><p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes widened for a moment and then narrowed his eyes. As for the others, they were greatly shocked.</p><p>Then in a gust of wind, Han Li tossed the flying sword back into the air.</p><p>Fairy Xu quickly cast a spell seal at it with joy on her face and quickly regained control. Afterwards, she chanted an incantation and flicked her fingers, striking the sword one after another, completely filling the sword with the entirety of her magic power.</p><p>Afterwards, the flying sword let out a series of drones and trembled. A layer of silver flames appeared on its surface and wrapped around it, instantly transforming it into a three-meter-long silver flame bird.</p><p>The temperature in the entire hall steeply dropped as soon as the flame bird appeared. Even a layer of white shining frost began to appear on the ground.</p><p>Fairy Xu let out a delicate shout and the flame bird wildly flapped its wings, changing into the green flying sword.</p><p>Seeing that the ice sword was greatly empowered by Han Li, the dwarf let out a trace of terror and could only grit his teeth, casting a spell seal and commanding his own magic treasure.</p><p>The green sword blurred as light brightly shined from it. It took the form of a horned green wyrm and fiercely charged forward.</p><p>A loud explosion shook the air.</p><p>The green wyrm and the silver flame bird collided, weaving green light and silver flames together. The bird then opened its mouth and bit off half of the flood dragon&rsquo;s body, devouring it without a trace.</p><p>The dwarf loudly shouted and spat out a glob of blood. He was stupefied in fear.</p><p>A loud bang sounded from the flame bird and turned into a silver ice mist, covering the damaged green wyrm entirely.</p><p>Under the glow of silver light, a loud crack sounded. A thirty-meter-tall boulder of ice appeared in the air.</p><p>The flood dragon let out a wail inside the ice and it disappeared, only leaving behind a flying sword that dimly shined.</p><p>Unnoticed by everyone, a thin thread of silver light appeared shot out the mist when the Green Wave Blade revealed itself and silently vanished inside of it.</p><p>A strange scene occurred.</p><p>The dwarf was clearly sixty meters away from his magic treasure, but at the same time his blade was frozen, his body collapsed onto the floor as if he fainted.</p><p>This was a heaven-defying ability of the Spirit Engulfing Flame.</p><p>Even Spatial Tempering cultivators couldn&#39;t guard against this ability, let alone the magic treasure of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Even if it was strengthened, it collapsed in a single strike.</p><p>When Fairy Xu saw this, she quickly waved her hand in delight.</p><p>The silver ice mist condensed back into a silver flying sword and returned to her.</p><p>Along the way, a ball of silver flame left the sword and shot back towards Han Li, soon to disappear into his body.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old man Huang Bao recovered from his shock and his body in his rage. He soon appeared at his disciple&rsquo;s side and he quickly discovered a layer of frost on the dwarf&rsquo;s body. His face was blue as if he died from frostbite.</p><p>&ldquo;A frozen soul in his body!&rdquo; When Huang Bao saw this, he wore a face of shock.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was still a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator. He instantly waved his sleeve at the huge boulder of ice and released a streak of red light.</p><p>Bang. The light quickly coiled around the boulder and a cloud of flame entered the ice.</p><p>The temperature in the hall sharply rose and the ice was thawed in an instant and the green flying sword recovered its freedom. It immediately returned into the dwarf&rsquo;s body.</p><p>Han Li looked on with an indifferent expression.</p><p>To conceal the true abilities of the Spirit Engulfing Flames, he reduced its power and had the Ice Crystal Sword itself freeze over the blade. Otherwise, with its abilities as a Heavenly Flame, the ice it left behind wouldn&rsquo;t have been easily thawed. However, he did display a bit of might to make sure they knew better than to bother him.</p><p>He previously commanded a trace of the Spirit Engulfing Flames&rsquo;s extreme cold and had it enter the flying sword. Through the dwarf&rsquo;s mental connection, he had it invade the dwarf&rsquo;s body.</p><p>This ability to freeze the soul and affect the body was an ability he had only been able to use recently.</p><p>He also researched related information about this once before. This ability was quite powerful and could only be achieved by a few legendary glacial flames.</p><p>As such, it was truly quite effective.</p><p>Han Li became an enigmatic figure in the old man&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>The old man quickly took out a fire-red medicine pill and placed it in the dwarf&rsquo;s mouth. He saw the blue color on his face quickly fade away and he let out a breath before looking at Han Li with a wavering expression.</p><p>Having thought to himself for a moment, the old man eventually saluted Han Li with a forced smile and said, &ldquo;Brother Han&rsquo;s abilities are quite fearsome. It is my loss. My disciple will drop the matter of marriage. I will bid farewell.&rdquo;</p><p>He then brought the dwarf out from the hall.</p><p>Han Li returned the salute, but he said nothing else. When he saw all trace of the old man leave, his expression sank. Before Fairy Xu could utter her thanks, he coldly asked, &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;</p><p>Fairy Xu was startled. Before she knew the meaning of Han Li&rsquo;s words, the green-eyed man hurriedly explained, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Senior Han. Huang Bao and his disciple comes from a small sect known as Quicksand Valley. It isn&rsquo;t some ancient sect. Huang Bao himself is the sect&rsquo;s greatest cultivator.</p><p>&ldquo;So it was like that. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about any further troubles!&rdquo; Han Li then turned to her and said, &ldquo;Fellow Daoist Xu, this will be the only time I go out of my way to help you. If something else comes to trouble you, you&rsquo;d best fend for yourself!&rdquo;</p><p>Fairy Xu&rsquo;s heart sank, and she respectfully answered, &ldquo;This Junior understands. Many thanks for your help, Senior. I definitely won&rsquo;t trouble you in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Han Li nodded and then walked out of the hall in bold steps before taking off.</p><p>When the green-eyed man saw Han Li left, he wryly laughed and said, &ldquo;That silver flame actually possessed the power of extreme cold and was able to freeze the soul and enter the body. But it doesn&rsquo;t match the glacial flames of legend. Fellow Daoist Xu, Senior Han seems to look after you. Do you know what flame it is?&rdquo;</p><p>Fairy Xu let out a sigh and said, &ldquo;Senior Han has a faint relation to my ancestor, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard of this glacial flame. On the patrol, he engulfed an entire fused beastman with that flame. Having that ability isn&rsquo;t so strange, but it seems that he isn&rsquo;t fond of others hearing about him. Brother Zhuo had best keep quiet about this, or else...&rdquo;</p><p>When he heard this, his expression changed and he nodded in agreement.</p><p>During that time, Han Li was flying towards the market in an azure streak.</p><p>According to his information, the auction should begin at noon. It would be at the time he arrived.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1337.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1339.html">Next</a></li>

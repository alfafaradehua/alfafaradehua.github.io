                                    <p>Chapter 1096: The Three Grand Demon Cultivators</p><p>Several near-transparent demon beasts flew at the top of the white snowstorms and stealthily moved forward in the winterland.</p><p>These were demon beasts were known as Glacial Imps, born from glacial Qi. Although they were only grade-six demon beasts, they ruthless cold that froze the air posed little threat to them. Rather, they moved through it with vigor, much like a fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the Glacial Imp leading them stopped. Its several eyes opened on both of its sides as it doubtfully looked in a certain direction within the snowstorm. The other imps had stopped and done the same.</p><p>Suddenly, the sounds of tearing air sounded and several red threads broke through the winds. At incredible speeds, they penetrated the imps.</p><p>With the sharp cracks of their demon cores splitting into two, the imps lifelessly dropped to the ground.</p><p>At that moment, a silhouette slowly emerged from within the storm, a female North Night Palace cultivator who wore a white cloak.</p><p>Her emotionless eyes observed the fluttering snow for just a moment before blurring out of sight once more.</p><p>...</p><p>In an area fifty kilometers away, there was a six-meter-tall figure with an ox head. It was walking across the sparkling surface of a frozen lake.</p><p>A pair of pitch-black horns jutted from its head and its fur flickered with blue light. It carried a huge saber on its back and his buttocks twisted in a ridiculous clumsiness as it walked.</p><p>But if a human cultivator were to see this demon beast, they wouldn&rsquo;t be laughing by any stretch as the figure was grade seven demon beast on the verge of metamorphosis.</p><p>Due to North Night Island&rsquo;s fully-activated restrictions, all demon beasts below grade eight were forced to tread through the ground, resulting in those less skilled in movement techniques to move forward at a snail&rsquo;s pace.</p><p>Suddenly, the huge saber on the demon beast&rsquo;s back blurred and seemingly disappeared from sight.</p><p>A huge boom soon followed, along with a miserable cry.</p><p>A wide and immensely deep cut had appeared on the surface of the lake.</p><p>The bull-headed demon then began to leisurely examine it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, mists of blood spouted from the cracks as well as a bisected corpse. From its clothes, it appeared to belong to a disciple from North Night Palace.</p><p>The disciple used ice movement techniques to move underneath the lake in preparation to ambush the demon, but he was seen through and was executed in a single strike.</p><p>With a trace of savage cruelty on its face, the demon reached out with its hand and summoned the corpse half into its grasp.</p><p>It widely opened its mouth and chomped down.</p><p>In the time it took to finish a cup of tea, the corpse-half filled the demon&rsquo;s stomach to satisfaction.</p><p>Similar scenes of slaughter occurred throughout North Night Island, of low-grade demon beasts being ambushed and cultivators being devoured.</p><p>However, all battles taking place were against low-grade demon beasts and cultivators at Core Formation-stage and below. Nascent Soul cultivators and grade-eight demon beasts, however, didn&rsquo;t seem to notice these battles as one side stayed inside their city of ice and the other rushed through the snowstorms.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t that the high-grade demon beasts didn&rsquo;t want to kill the palace&rsquo;s low-grade cultivators, but rather, it was difficult to find them amidst the snowstorms and activated restrictions, not to mention these cultivators were skilled in various evasion techniques.</p><p>A few of these North Night Palace cultivators even wore particular magic tools that concealed their scent, making it even more difficult to discover them.</p><p>Even if these demons managed to kill a few cultivators on occasion, it would do little to affect the war as a whole. It would be better for them to conserve their strength for the upcoming battle. Every sliver of magic power is significant in a battle of life and death after all.</p><p>When the many demons drew close to the city of ice, the beautiful middle-aged Elder Liu was sitting inside a hall in the Hidden Arctic Dragon Boundary. Sitting across from her were two rows of North Night Palace elders, all of them listening to the reports of a white-clothed palace disciple.</p><p>The disciple respectfully said, &ldquo;Of the hundred high-grade disciples that were dispatched, thirty-seven of their lifesoul tiles were shattered. From the information we&rsquo;ve acquired, there were a hundred twenty-seven demon beasts killed, a majority of them being from the Ice Sea. we&rsquo;ve already dispatched the second wave of disciples. It should take about two hours before they group up with the first wave.&rdquo;</p><p>After a brief pause, Elder Liu commanded, &ldquo;Thirty-seven disciples have already perished in battle. It should be about time for them to be a few thousand kilometers from the city. Notify Elder Ye that the Sea Calming Bell will be used in two hours. We&rsquo;ll be inflicting heavy losses on the low-grade demon beasts. It would be greatly troublesome if we allowed a large number of pests to bother us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Palace Lord!&rdquo; A white-haired elder with a child-like face immediately waved his hand and released a sound transmission, sending it out of the hall.</p><p>The woman then &ldquo;Junior Martial Brother Ding, make sure the grand formation is fully activated. I suspect that using this treasure will incite the high-grade demon beasts out of grief for their lesser brethren.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The other elder flew off as soon as he gave his reply.</p><p>&ldquo;In addition, you&rsquo;ll need to inform the disciples outside of the city to be careful. The suppression of the Sea Calming Bell will only last a half-hour at most. After that, it&rsquo;ll be over a hundred years before we&rsquo;ll be able to use it again. After the elapsed time had passed, the disciples are to immediately return to the city and seal off the secret teleportation formations. We can&rsquo;t have the demons use them to invade!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you command!&rdquo;</p><p>With a string of commands uttered, the other elders began to move and carry out her orders.</p><p>...</p><p>Hundreds of kilometers away from the icy city, a large group of high-grade demons arrived on top of a small ice mountain.</p><p>They were at the very edge of the North Night Palace&rsquo;s protective grand formation. As they looked at the glacial mist flying in front of them, the metamorphosed demons wore a solemn expression.</p><p>These demons clearly belonged to two groups. One group numbered about a dozen and were surrounding a tall old man and a short child. The other group consisted of over twenty and were escorting a slender silver-clothed woman.</p><p>But oddly enough, these demons all looked quite ordinary. Apart from a few discrepancies in their appearance, they were no different than human cultivators. And even stranger was how each group looked at each other with contempt.</p><p>The larger group of demons wore hateful expressions and clothes made of fur. There were even those that left their chest uncovered.</p><p>They carried a large assortment of weapons in either their hands or back. They also hung storage pouches made of hide on their waist. While it was unknown why they didn&rsquo;t keep their weapons there, these demon beasts emitted violent intent as they gazed at the other group.</p><p>The two groups of demon beasts faced one another with a clear gap between them.</p><p>But if any cultivator were to come across them, they would fearfully run away.</p><p>They were all metamorphosed demon beasts at grade eight and higher. The old man, the child, and the silver-clothed woman, in particular, were grade ten demon beasts.</p><p>Such power would likely be able to instantly crush any of the ten great sects of the Righteous or Devilish Dao. High-grade demon beasts were already more powerful than their equivalently-ranked cultivator counterparts.</p><p>The black-robed old man amongst them had a stern and squarish face with spirited eyes; his grey hair faintly glowed with azure light, overall producing an aura of self confidence.</p><p>Next to him was the boy that appeared seven years old with a delicate, nearly otherworldly appearance. His irises were faintly red and he wore a faint smile.</p><p>The silver-robed woman facing him had snow-white skin and beauty capable of toppling nations.</p><p>However, this gorgeous woman was escorted by many formidable high-grade demons, who didn&rsquo;t dare to meet her gaze. They looked down as if in fear.</p><p>The old man said with a chuckle, &ldquo;Fairy Feng, I didn&rsquo;t expect that these North Night Palace cultivators were truly willing to attack. They actually released the glacial Qi they were accumulating for nearly a thousand years. I&rsquo;ll have to see how they respond when they encounter another great enemy in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman&rsquo;s expression stirred and she coldly said, &ldquo;Fellow Daoist Qing, why do you ask despite knowing the answer? The North Night Palace cultivators do not know that our objective this time isn&rsquo;t the Glacial Quintessence, so it is natural for them to hold nothing back. Otherwise, if our line of defense is broken, it won&#39;t matter how much glacial Qi they store.&quot;</p><p>The child then opened his mouth and spoke with an aged raspy voice, &ldquo;However, I am quite surprised to see that Fellow Daoist Feng had personally made an appearance. For over two thousand years, you&rsquo;ve entered seclusion in the icy depths.&rdquo;</p><p>The silver-robed woman shifted her gaze to the child and calmly said, &ldquo;If it were for anything else apart from passage up to the Spirit Realm, I wouldn&rsquo;t have left. Didn&rsquo;t you also send your incarnation over here?&rdquo;</p><p>The child narrowed his eyes and chuckled, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to readily agree with my proposal! How surprising! It seems you&rsquo;ve been dissatisfied with North Night Island since long ago and have thought about exterminating Fairy Ice Soul&rsquo;s line of cultivators in the mortal realm. Fellow Daoist Feng, you are relying rather heavily on the power of our Myriad Demon Valley!&rdquo;</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1095.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1097.html">Next</a></li>

                                    <h3>Chapter 2237: Battle Against the Stemborer Queen (1)</h3><p>"So are we just supposed to trust the others? What if they take advantage of the opportunity to teleport away?" Han Li asked through voice transmission.</p><p>"Rest assured, Brother Han, I tampered with the Treasured Phoenix Spirit Plate that I gave to everyone, so as long as I don't allow it, they won't be able to use the formation plates. Once they're all made aware of this, I'm sure they wouldn't dare to try anything," Bao Hua revealed with a smile.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, she turned and transmitted her voice toward the others.</p><p>Han Li cast his gaze toward the elderly man and black-robed woman, and sure enough, upon hearing what Bao Hua had to say, enraged looks appeared on both of their faces.</p><p>In contrast, Bao Hua's expression remained unchanged, and she even had the nerve to smile at the two of them.</p><p>The elderly man and black-robed woman were naturally extremely furious; if it weren't for the fact that they were facing such a fearsome enemy, they could've easily turned on Bao Hua already.</p><p>Before they had a chance to communicate any further, the little girl cast her gaze toward them, and giggled, "Have you thought about how to compensate me? How about this? Hand over your Nascent Souls, and perhaps I'll be full after eating one or two more, and I'll let the rest of you leave."</p><p>"Do you really think such a blatant attempt to sow dissension among us will work? If we allow you to kill one more of us, the rest of us will completely be at your mercy," Bao Hua replied in a calm manner, then immediately swept a hand through the air.</p><p>The Earth Emperor Nail embedded into the black crystal instantly vanished, then reappeared in her grasp.</p><p>"Oh? So you're determined to fight me? You were able to survive one of my attacks, and that's certainly quite remarkable. However, your Nascent Soul isn't the one I want to eat the most right now; it's his! His spiritual sense is so powerful; I'm sure his Nascent Soul would be far more delicious than the one I just had," the little girl said with a smile as she pointed toward Han Li.</p><p>Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and Bao Hua and the others were also rather taken aback. </p><p>Judging from what the Stemborer Queen had just said, it seemed that Han Li's spiritual sense was even more powerful than that of Bao Hua's, and that was quite surprising.</p><p>"If you think my Nascent Soul will be quite good to eat, then come and get it," Han Li said with a faint smile, seemingly completely unfazed by the little girl's threat.</p><p>Bao Hua and the others couldn't help but admire his courage. After all, not everyone could remain so calm and nonchalant in the face of a threat from a being as fearsome as the Stemborer Queen.</p><p>"Alright, then don't mind if I do!" the little girl said as she licked her lips and clenched her fists, then suddenly shot forth as a blurry shadow.</p><p>She was so fast that she reached Han Li in an instant, and he couldn't even clearly see how she had gotten there. A black flaming fist pierced through Han Li's chest, and only then did the shadow solidify as the little re-emerged with a smile on her face.</p><p>However, in the next instant, her smile immediately faded as a green line swept forth from Han Li's body without any warning, slicing the little girl's body cleanly in half.</p><p>As for the Han Li that had just been struck by her punch, it suddenly exploded into a ball of golden light.</p><p>Over 100 feet away, another Han Li emerged expressionlessly amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, holding a green longsword that was releasing hints of powers of law.</p><p>"That sword of yours is a Profound Heavenly Treasure! No wonder you were able to evade my attack; looks like it won't be that easy to take you down."</p><p>A burst of giggling rang out, and the two halves of the little girl's body didn't shed a single drop of blood as they hovered in mid-air, while the two halves of her mouth curved upward into an unsettling smile.</p><p>Both the elderly man and black-robed woman couldn't help but shudder in the face of such a disturbing sight.</p><p>Right at this moment, Bao Hua suddenly raised a hand to hurl her Earth Emperor Nail through the air, then abruptly vanished amid a flash of pink light.</p><p>At the same time, her voice rang out within the ears of the elderly man and black-robed woman. "We have to act now, fellow daoists; only after destroying the Stemborer Queen's body will we be able to escape from this place. Fellow Daoist Han and I won't be able to hold off this clone for too long, so you have to make haste."</p><p>The elderly man and black-robed woman's expressions changed several times, but after exchanging a glance, they could only grit their teeth and plunge into the water down below.</p><p>Even though they were enraged by Bao Hua's tampering of the Treasured Phoenix Spirit Plates, they had no choice but to work with her now.</p><p>The little girl's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and she immediately tried to stop them, but a giant nail suddenly appeared above of the two halves of her body, then transformed into a yellow net that descended toward her.</p><p>Countless yellow runes surged out of the net alongside a burst of extremely formidable power of laws.</p><p>A cold light flashed through the little girl's eyes as her body suddenly exploded into countless black threads that shot forth in all directions, allowing her to evade the yellow net.</p><p>A fierce look appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and he let loose a loud cry as his Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword also transformed into countless green threads that vanished into thin air before appearing right in front of the black threads, then unleashed a barrage of ferocious attacks.</p><p>All of the black threads that came into contact with the green threads immediately exploded into clouds of black Qi.</p><p>Han Li pointed a finger forward, planning to spur on the green threads to eradicate all of this black Qi, but right at this moment, the clouds of black Qi suddenly dissipated, and in the next instant, the little girl re-emerged elsewhere amid a flash of black light, having completely recovered from her injuries.</p><p>She turned toward Han Li with a cold smile, yet just as she was about to unleash some type of ability, a peculiar aroma suddenly wafted through the arid around her.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, countless pink flower petals emerged, and the surrounding space suddenly became extremely viscous.</p><p>The little girl was quite alarmed by this, and she quickly tried to escape, but all of a sudden, Bao Hua emerged above her, carrying a giant ball of light that she immediately raised up high.</p><p>The ball of light exploded, and countless runes surged out of it, all of which were extremely dazzling to behold.</p><p>At the epicenter of the explosion, a wisp of green light appeared, transforming into a tiny green seedling, which grew to become a small tree in the blink of an eye and was still growing at a rapid rate discernible to the naked eye.</p><p>All of a sudden, a huge green tree had taken shape over Bao Hua's palm.</p><p>Specks of pink light appeared all over the tree's branches, transforming into pink flower buds that instantly spread over the entire tree.</p><p>Bao Hua then began to chant an incantation, and the flower buds slowly bloomed, turning the green tree a pink color.</p><p>Pink flower projections filled the entire space within a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers, creating a vast sea of pink.</p><p>"This is a Profound Heavenly Spirit Domain!" the little girl exclaimed as her smile finally faded, and a fierce look appeared on her face as countless grey runes appeared around her.</p><p>The surrounding space began to twist and warp, and it seemed that she was trying to escape the domain with all her might.</p><p>The entire domain also began to tremor violently, as if it were struggling to hold itself together.</p><p>An urgent look appeared on Bao Hua's face as she hurriedly yelled, "Strike now, Fellow Daoist Han!"</p><p>As soon as her voice trailed off, she grabbed onto a branch of the tree and tore it off before slashing it toward the little girl down below. All of the huge flowers on the branch instantly transformed into five-colored runes that vanished in a flash, while the little girl let loose an agonized cry as one of her arms suddenly disappeared.</p><p>At the same time, the branch in Bao Hua's hand had also vanished.</p><p>However, in the next instant, the little girl was able to regrow a brand new arm amid a flash of black light.</p><p>Bao Hua immediately tore two more branches off the tree before also slashing them toward the little girl.</p><p>In the next instant, both of the little girl's arms vanished in unison.</p><p>A ferocious look surfaced in the little girl's eyes, and she regrew both of her arms at once.</p><p>Meanwhile, Han Li was making a hand seal with a serious expression, and a string of cracks and pops immediately erupted within his body. </p><p>A series of purplish-golden scales then appeared all over his skin, and a short horn emerged on his forehead.</p><p>At the same time, two identical heads and four additional golden arms also sprouted out of his body.</p><p>The three heads let loose a thunderous roar in unison, and a third demonic eye opened up on the glabella of each head with purplish-golden light flashing within them.</p><p>Han Li had unleashed his Holy Nirvana Physique to its maximal extent!</p><p>His aura had swelled to over 10 times as powerful as it had been, and he gripped onto his Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword with both hands before slashing it viciously toward the trapped little girl in the distance.</p><p>

                                    <h4>Chapter 644: Thirty Year Agreement</h4><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon widely opened her eyes and she hesitantly said, &ldquo;Master, you... you&rsquo;re serious?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to know whether or not my words hold true. For now, call that woman in for me. At her current cultivation, she shouldn&rsquo;t be able to see through your human form.&rdquo; Han Li casually commanded.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of her suspicions, she respectfully replied, &ldquo;As you bid, Master!&rdquo; Han Li then turned around and entered the large hall.</p><p dir="ltr">After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Silvermoon gracefully entered the hall with a haggard Mu Peiling. It seemed that this short time had been quite stressful for her.</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon glanced at Han Li and respectfully said, &ldquo;Master, Young Lady Mu has arrived.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li nodded his head and indifferently said, &ldquo;I am aware. You may leave.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;This servant is excused!&rdquo; Silvermoon shot a glance at Mu Peiling and departed from hall with a pursed smile.</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I pay my respects to Senior Han.&rdquo; After saluting Han Li, she remained helplessly silent as if she were awaiting punishment from Han Li.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li slightly frowned in response to her appearance and he examined her beautiful face.</p><p dir="ltr">Without revealing the slightest anger, he calmly said, &ldquo;You should know why I&rsquo;ve called you in. You blurted out words to those cultivation clans that gave them a domineering impression of me. After all, seizing an engaged woman as a concubine can&rsquo;t be something that is easily taken. Of course at my current cultivation, the Mu and Yan Clan wouldn&rsquo;t dare to complain, nor do I hold them in much esteem. However, this doesn&#39;t mean that I will tolerate your presumptuous actions. You should realize I will punish you.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">The woman raised her head and spoke with a pale complexion, &ldquo;Please forgive me Senior. This woman has truly been reckless. But rather than wed into the Yan Clan, Junior would find it preferable to become Senior&rsquo;s concubine.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li&rsquo;s gaze flickered and he snorted before slowly continuing, &ldquo;Since you said that you were to be my concubine, I can no longer stay uninvolved, nor can I make clear that this is untrue. Otherwise, these cultivation clans will recognize me, this new Drifting Cloud Sect Elder, to be weak and feeble, incapable of protecting even a Foundation Establishment woman underneath him. And these rumors should&rsquo;ve already spread throughout the cultivation world as well. So tell me, how should I deal with you?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Mu Peiling bit her lips and softly said, &ldquo;Junior has nothing to say. I will have no complaints in how Senior will punish me.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Since cultivators on the outside know you to be my concubine, I will give you two choices. The first is to pretend to be my concubine, but you will actually be my servant and obey my orders. After you&rsquo;ve served me for twenty years, the matter should&rsquo;ve faded and I will let you free. However, you had best avoid any thoughts that I will assist with the cultivation of a servant girl.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">When Mu Peiling heard this, she revealed a trace of disappointment and raised her head, asking, &ldquo;Then, what is the second choice?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li stared at the woman and calmly said, &ldquo;The second option is make this fiction a reality, to become my concubine in truth. You will attend to me through your life. I will not treat my own spouse pettily and will guide you in your cultivation if my mood is willing. However, I must first tell you that if you wish to become my concubine, I will place a soul restriction on you to prevent any possible betrayal. After all, if you were to suddenly changed your mind, my secrets could possibly be laid bare.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I...&rdquo; Mu Peiling grew distracted upon hearing him and her expression fluttered as if she were deeply considering Han Li&rsquo;s thoughts. It seems this woman didn&rsquo;t greatly oppose the thought of marrying Han Li.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li indifferently said, &ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;ve always been proud. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator such as myself isn&rsquo;t your ideal husband. However, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. Fellow Daoist Mu isn&rsquo;t my ideal Dao companion either, but this won&rsquo;t stop me from taking you in as a concubine. If you obtain my protection, you will tread farther on the path of cultivation without much cost.</p><p dir="ltr">And in these past few years, you&rsquo;ve come to know that I&rsquo;m not a brutal or craven eccentric. Even if I place down a restriction on your soul, I won&rsquo;t mistreat you or cause you hardship. And later on, I may even grow to trust you and remove those restrictions. It either will be this, or acting as my servant for twenty years! Those years as a servant shouldn&rsquo;t pass by too slowly.&rdquo; His eyes moved away from her as if he didn&rsquo;t mind what she chose.</p><p dir="ltr">Mu Peiling&rsquo;s heart grew turbulent. While she was unwilling to be controlled by another, the assistance and guidance of a Nascent Soul cultivator was also hard to pass. Unable to come to a decision, she hesitantly said, &ldquo;Senior, could I have two days to consider this?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">As for becoming Han Li&rsquo;s concubine, she already knew what Han Li had described; it couldn&rsquo;t be said to be a bad decision in the slightest. Countless beautiful, young Foundation Establishment women would be tempted to take the offer of becoming the concubine of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p dir="ltr">Without any intention of making it difficult for her, Han Li leniently nodded his head, &ldquo;You may. Come back after two days with your answer. It should be enough time for you to come to a decision.&rdquo; He then called for Silvermoon to take her out.</p><p dir="ltr">After saluting, Mu Peiling followed Silvermoon&rsquo;s lead and absentmindedly left the hall.</p><p dir="ltr">A short moment later, Silvermoon gracefully walked back inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon&rsquo;s bright eyes flickered and she mysteriously smiled, &ldquo;Master, the two conditions you raised are somewhat...&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li glanced at Silvermoon and said, &ldquo;What? Do you think they&rsquo;re too harsh? Don&rsquo;t they align with her wishes?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon sighed and softly said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t about harshness. It&rsquo;s merely that this woman possesses an unyielding heart. With her pride, it would be difficult for her to choose either option. But if Master truly accepts this girl, then a soul restriction is undoubtedly necessary considering his many secrets.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li attentively took measure of Silvermoon and spoke with slight surprise, &ldquo;You seem to have quite a favorable impression of her.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon was momentarily surprised before wryly smiling, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t it. It&rsquo;s just that her staunch character gives me a familiar feeling. It seemed in the past that I had a close relationship to someone with a similar nature. I&rsquo;ve unconsciously grown concerned with her.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li nodded his head and didn&rsquo;t pursue the matter any further.</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon tactfully avoided mentioning Mu Peiling and instead discussed the matter of refining the Celestial Ice Flames, Han Li&rsquo;s most pressing matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Two days later, Mu Peiling arrived once more and she was led into the main hall by Silvermoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li glanced at the woman and bluntly asked, &ldquo;So, you should&rsquo;ve already came to a decision. Will you be my servant for twenty years or will I be placing a soul restriction on you?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">It was the clear the woman had made up her mind. She took a quick breath and calmly said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already decided. In the cultivation world, it could be considered destiny for a low grade female cultivator to be given an opportunity to become the concubine of a Nascent Soul cultivator. However, I hope Senior will make a promise before I become his concubine. So long as this condition is met, I am willing to be be restricted by your spiritual sense and spend the rest of my life under you.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;A condition? Go ahead and speak.&rdquo; Han Li&rsquo;s face remained unchanged as if he had already anticipated this.</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I know Senior Han isn&rsquo;t a hasty character. As such, I hope that Senior will pledge to hold off for thirty years before he takes my vital yin. I am currently at a crucial point in my cultivation and wish to see whether or not I can form a core within thirty years. It is extremely important for my cultivation art that I remain a virgin. It was for this reason that I was unwilling to be married. Regardless of whether or not I form my core within this time, Senior may pair cultivate with me once time has passed.&rdquo; Perhaps thinking that the conditions were too harsh or that speaking of the matter of pair cultivation was embarrassing, her face blushed after this was all said, revealing a captivating expression.</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thirty years? Haha! That&rsquo;s fine. I can agree to your condition.&rdquo; Once Han Li heard this, his eyes brightly flickered and he instantly agreed.</p><p dir="ltr">Mu Peiling was amazed that Han Li had so quickly agreed, but she soon recovered and joyfully said, &ldquo;Many thanks to Senior!&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">After pondering for a moment, Han Li said, &ldquo;In two days, I will officially notify the other two elders of the sect that I&rsquo;ve taken you in as a concubine. But since it will be thirty years before we actually pair cultivate, I will open a smaller separate cave residence for your cultivation among one of the other three mountains. Of course if I have the time, I will go over and give you some guidance.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yes, as you wish.&rdquo; Mu Peiling was clearly very satisfied with these results and approved without thought.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li&rsquo;s expression relaxed and he mysteriously smiled, &ldquo;As my future concubine, there is no need to always address me as Senior. You may just call me Sir. I am only two hundred years old, and am quite young considering my lifespan is now over a thousand years.&rdquo; Han Li then sized up the beautiful woman without any restraint, clearly appreciating the view.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-643.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-645.html">Next</a></li>

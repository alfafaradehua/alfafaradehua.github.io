                                    <p><strong>Chapter 121: Clear River Brothel</strong></p><p>Shen Zhongshan&rsquo;s current mood was quite good. He was currently sitting in a private room of the Clear River Brothel and embracing an exceptionally beautiful girl, using his large hands to grope her delicate body in a vulgar manner.</p><p>Maybe it was due to Shen Zhongshan&rsquo;s impatience, but his handling caused the gorgeously enchanting maiden to giggle nonstop.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Jin, I think you should just submit to our Gang Leader already! This is the first time our Gang Leader has been so infatuated with a woman. He came here in such a hurry even though the gang&rsquo;s affairs have not been completely dealt with.&rdquo; The person who said this was a dark fatty who wore loose-fitting gray garments. His waist was as large as a bucket, and his legs were twice the size a normal person&rsquo;s. &nbsp;After speaking, he was somewhat gasping for breath.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Miss Jinzhi! Our Gang Leader has visited your establishment every afternoon for five days in a row and spent a large sum of money! Furthermore, you profited quite a bit. You only let our Gang Leader embrace you for a while and never let him spend the night with you even once. This just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense!&rdquo; The one who spoke this time was a middle aged scholar with a mole on his face. His eyes exuded a hidden fierceness, making him seem like a scheming person.</p><p>Currently, besides Shen Zhongshan, there were three other people in the room. They were none other than Fourth Level Gang&rsquo;s three Great Protectors.</p><p>The dark fatty was &ldquo;Mad Fist&rdquo; Qian Jing. Disregarding his oddly plump size, he was actually extremely proficient in the &ldquo;Berserk Eighteen Strike&rdquo; and had killed many reputable experts.</p><p>The Confusian scholar was &ldquo;Poison Scholar&rdquo; Fan Ju. Even though he practiced a very swift and fierce &ldquo;Snow Wind&rdquo; sword technique, what made his name famous worldwide was his dark heart, fierce methods, and sinister intentions.</p><p>Standing at one side was a dark-clothed person who had not spoken a word since the start. He was the strongest out of the three Great Protectors, &ldquo;Throwing Dagger&rdquo; Shen San. His unique skill of sending out eighteen throwing daggers in succession had previously helped Shen Zhongshan get rid of many experts who pursued a vendetta against him. In addition, Shen San was also Shen Zhongshan&rsquo;s distant relative. Thus, he was the one Shen Zhongshan regarded the most highly in the Fourth Level Gang.</p><p>Just like Shen Zhongshan, each of the three Protectors had a pretty girl sitting in their embrace. But these girls were nothing like the girl in Shen Zhongshan&rsquo;s embrace. She was delicate, charming, flirtatious and finely developed in figure.</p><p>At this moment, when the giggling little Jinzhi heard &ldquo;Mad Fist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poison Expert&rdquo; Fan Ju&rsquo;s words, her eyes immediately began to tear up, as if a teardrop might fall at any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;When Master Fan and Master Qian speak like this, you are wrongly accusing Jinzhi. The moment others see Master Shen, they would immediately know that he is a hero! To be able to fly together and nest together with Master Shen, that is all that Jinzhi wishes for!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;However, both of you also know that my body belongs to Clear River Brothel. Without the brothel&rsquo;s Elderly Lady Wang&rsquo;s approval, if Jinzhi were to leave and receive patrons without permission, I will be beaten to death. Why doesn&rsquo;t Master Shen go and ask Elderly Lady Wang? If she agrees to let Jinzhi receive patrons, then I will definitely wait upon Master Shen diligently tonight.&rdquo; The lead prostitute of the Clear River Brothel spoke in a sincere tone of sweet reasonableness and looked at Shen Zhongshan with extreme adoration.</p><p>Her words seemed quite believable yet fake at the same time, making Qian Jin and Fan Ju look at each other speechlessly in dismay.</p><p>Of course they had asked for the price of spending the night with little Jinzhi. Using the excuse of little Jinzhi having never spent the night with a patron before, Elderly Lady Wang demanded an exorbitant price that made Gang Leader Shen Zhongshan&rsquo;s heart skip a beat. Thus, they had never reached an agreement.</p><p>It was even more impossible to use force to negotiate. The Clear River Brothel was the property of Jia Yuan City&rsquo;s third largest gang, the Heavenly Tyrant Sect.</p><p>After hitting a snag with this giant red card, Qian Jin and Fan Ju could only vent their frustration on the Clear River Brothel&rsquo;s girls who were in their arms. Only after groping them ferociously did they let the matter drop.</p><p>&ldquo;Hehe, many thanks to the two worthy little brothers for being concern about my affairs. But don&rsquo;t worry, two days ago I made a great business deal. This small amount of money isn&rsquo;t too much. On the contrary, you, beautiful lady, cannot go back on your words! You must properly wait upon this Lord Master when the time comes!&rdquo; The addicted Shen Zhongshan said contentedly as he suddenly turned towards little Jinzhi, who was in his embrace, and nibbled her fragrant cheek.</p><p>Shen Zhongshan was a huge man with very hairy arms and chest. His two arms were much longer than that of an average human. Thus, his whole person looked like a beast wearing clothes, truly so ugly that he could frighten people.</p><p>A few years ago, this extremely boorish man used &ldquo;Open Arm Punch&rdquo;, a skill that he mastered to perfection, to kill the Fourth Level Gang&rsquo;s predecessor, Gou Tianpo, and his trusted aides, the four great Warlords, thereby seizing the position as Gang Leader. Therefore, in the entire Jia Yuan City, he was definitely a part of the top ranking experts and must not be underestimated.</p><p>&ldquo;Master Shen&rdquo;, Little Jinzhi appeared very bashful when Shen Zhongshan sneakily bit her cheek and behaved like a spoiled child in his arms, making Shen Zhongshan quite pleased with himself as he laughed heartily.</p><p>Dong dong! Dong dong!&nbsp;Right in that moment, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; The dark fatty, &ldquo;Mad Fist&rdquo; Qian Jin was unhappy and shouted out the question in a bad mood.</p><p>&ldquo;I am here to deliver beverages to the gentlemen in the room.&rdquo; The voice of a youthful male came through from the outside.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you taking so slow to deliver? I&rsquo;ve already complained that there are not enough drinks!&rdquo; The dark fatty spoke without thinking when he heard the reply.</p><p>In the wake of Qian Jin&rsquo;s words, a young man wearing servant clothes came in. The ordinary-looking youth was holding a tray with both hands. There were several dishes and two bottles of alcohol on the tray.</p><p>&ldquo;Quickly bring the alcohol here. I want to see how it tastes like!&rdquo; Fatty Qian Jin was a typical drunkard. Thus his eyes immediately brightened up and he clamoured incessantly when he saw the two bottles of alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, this servant will carry it to you!&rdquo; This person, with an appearance of a young servant, walked forward a few steps and placed a wine cup on the table.</p><p>The moment the fatty saw the wine cup, he immediately grabbed it in his hand and wanted to down it to taste its flavour.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, fatty!&rdquo; The quiet black-clothed person, Shen San, suddenly stopped Qian Jin from pouring the alcohol into his mouth.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-120.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-122.html">Next</a></li>

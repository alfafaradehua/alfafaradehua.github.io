                                    <p>Chapter 1434: Jade Emperor Peak</p><p>Under close examination, the man that had the form of a red crane appeared very different from an ordinary human. His face was close enough, but his ears were sharp and there was a round red bulge from the top of his head.</p><p>As for the black-robed youth, there was a small black horn on his head and his mouth had a pair of sharp fangs several inches long.</p><p>As for the surrounding hundred Flying Spirit Tribe beings, most of them appeared different from humans, but they only had a few aspects that were different. But what was most different from all of them was the large variety in the color and length of their wings.</p><p>These people were all from the Flying Spirit Tribe.</p><p>&ldquo;The Horned Vulture Race&rsquo;s Devil Suppressing Bell is truly powerful. I&rsquo;ve received much experience.&rdquo; The defeated white-robed man uttered these words resentfully before being half-carried away.</p><p>&ldquo;Are there any others that wish to learn a thing or two?&rdquo; The black-robed youth said calmly, looking down at the crowd as he uttered a word of challenge.</p><p>The crowd became restless, but for a time no one stepped forward.</p><p>When the youth saw this, he sneered, but just as he thought to say something, someone spoke from a distance, &ldquo;Quickly look, holy disciples of the westmost branches, the Pentaluster, Tian Peng, and Chi Rong Races have arrived.&rdquo;</p><p>When the crowd heard this, they began to speak as if it were a race.</p><p>Those that were curious turned around, flying a distance away. In the blink of an eye, the crowd shrank by a small half.</p><p>When the black-robed youth heard this, his face slightly changed and he silently descended from the sky.</p><p>Meanwhile, in an area over fifty kilometers away from the huge mountain, apart from tens of various huge birds, there was also a sixty-meter-long crimson flying scorpion that was flying through to the mountain.</p><p>Among the huge birds, there were several with pure-white bodies with various men and women riding them. They were the Tian Peng Race.</p><p>Han Li was riding on top of one of the huge birds.</p><p>In the Tian Peng&rsquo;s party, Jin Yue and the mysterious Elder Shi rode alongside the holy disciples.</p><p>The red-bearded old man and the beautiful woman remained on guard at the holy city.</p><p>At that moment, they were together with two different groups.</p><p>One of the groups had purple hair and red skin. As for the other group, they had smaller wings and gorgeous robes.</p><p>They were respectively the Chi Rong and the Pentaluster Race. However, the meager five people of the Tian Peng Race were clearly fewer than the other two groups.</p><p>The gorgeous young female holy disciple smiled and said, &ldquo;Elder Jin, it appears that Jade Emperor Peak&rsquo;s elders knew we were coming and lit up the welcoming fires.&rdquo;</p><p>In a distance away above the huge mountain, there was a large rainbow flame burning, filling the air with a gorgeous glow.</p><p>The astonishing scene could be clearly seen by those fifty kilometers away.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems we weren&rsquo;t the first to arrive. Time truly passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, three hundred years already passed.&rdquo; Jin Yue turned to an old man with fire-red skin and said, &ldquo;Brother Zhu, what do you think about this place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What impression is there to be had?&rdquo; The old man expression asked, &ldquo;Unless we cultivate a True Spirit Body or to Soaring True Immortal Stage, we&rsquo;ll just be mounds of earth in tens of thousands of years. The prosperities of the tribe are replaced in turn. Has Elder Jin considered the matter I spoke a few days ago?&rdquo;</p><p>A bright glint flashed from the young woman&rsquo;s eyes and she indifferently replied, &ldquo;Our Tian Peng Race has truly become much weaker, but we&rsquo;ve survived since ancient times. We are the longest living branch of the tribe. We won&rsquo;t easily discard our legacy and throw ourselves into the embrace of another tribe. I&rsquo;ve put much thought into Brother Zhu&rsquo;s proposal to merge, but I can only refuse you.&rdquo;</p><p>Old Man Zhu coldly smiled and said, &ldquo;Is that so? If I remember correction, from ancient times, your esteemed Elder Shi came from the Black Feather Tribe, a branch that was annexed during your golden age. Now that your own tribe has been weakened, merging with a stronger tribe and handing over the master&rsquo;s position is a natural position.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can this matter relate to the Black Feather Tribe? At the time, the Black Feather Tribe weren&rsquo;t only lacking a holy master, but it also faced powerful enemies and took the initiative to merge with our tribe. We hadn&rsquo;t forced them.&rdquo; The young woman said with a casual tone.</p><p>Old Man Zhu chuckled and said, &ldquo;Those matters happened so long ago, who truly knows what actually happened. Since you&rsquo;ve rejected my clan&rsquo;s kind intentions, we&rsquo;ll have to see if your clan&rsquo;s holy disciples can make it through the earth abyss trial. If they fail, don&rsquo;t blame me if several branches form a council of elders and discuss the proposal to dismantle your clan. Don&rsquo;t forget that our Chi Rong race isn&rsquo;t the only one interested in your clan.&rdquo;</p><p>A charming young woman looked over to them with a sweet smile and said, &ldquo;Brother Zhu, your esteemed clan has become amongst the top three in strength among the seventy-two branches. There is no need to be so overbearing in your pursuit to consume the Tian Peng Race. Could it be you rush to forcefully contend with the Jiu Yue Race?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Qui, don&rsquo;t speak such rubbish. When did anybody from my clan say that?&rdquo; When the old man heard her, his face greatly changed.</p><p>Elder Qui smiled and thought to say more when heavenly music began to play from the direction of the mountain top. The sky&rsquo;s color then flickered and became more gorgeous.</p><p>They hastily shut their mouths and ceased flight as they floated in the air.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the ten variously dressed people, most of aging appearance and venerable bearing, appeared from the slight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We pay our respects to the Elders.&rdquo; When Jin Yue and the others saw these ten men, they jumped off their birds in alarm and deeply saluted them.</p><p>An old woman with a cane with a beaming smile and said, &ldquo;There is no need to regard us as outsiders. You&rsquo;ll join our ranks sooner or later. The other elders are awaiting you on Jade Emperor Peak.&rdquo;</p><p>Jin Yue&rsquo;s heart stirred and she respectfully asked, &ldquo;What? Could it be that our three branches were the last?&rdquo;</p><p>The old woman chuckled and answered, &ldquo;This is not the case. The northmost Gui Mian and Du Jiu branches were busy so we&rsquo;re able to start the earth abyss trial without them. With you three, we may begin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it was like that,&rdquo; Jin Yue nodded.</p><p>Standing behind them, Han Li felt his heart tremble when he saw the ten that appeared.</p><p>The ten were mostly at Body Integration cultivation. As for the old woman, he wasn&rsquo;t able to see through her cultivation stage. She was most likely the same as Jin Yue, a fearsome existence at Body Integration stage or higher.</p><p>This was the so-called joint assembly elders.</p><p>It was said that elders were originally from various tribes, but when their lifespans were nearing their end, they could join these elders and renounce their affiliation with their original branch, taking on the responsibilities of the entire Flying Spirit Tribe.</p><p>At that moment, Old Man Zhu and the young woman stepped forward and exchanged pleasantries with the old woman. Soon after, the party flew to the mountain under the guidance of the old woman.</p><p>A moment later, the party arrived near the huge mountain and the imposing buildings could be faintly seen. Black dots could be seen circling the air above it.</p><p>Under closer examination, Han Li discovered that there were hundreds of huge birds flying through the air as well as huge winged insects with malevolent appearances.</p><p>When the mountain appeared to only be a kilometer away, a muffled bang sounded. A seven-colored rainbow flew out in a curve from a long distance away towards them.</p><p>Soon after, a gorgeous arched bridge appeared above them.</p><p>The old woman and the others blurred, taking a step on the bridge and beckoning the others with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Jin Yue commanded. She then stepped off the bird and quickly walked on the bridge.</p><p>The other parties did the same.</p><p>When Han Li walked on the bridge, he felt that he was stepping on something completely soft like a thick cushion.</p><p>Curious, he wanted to take a close look and released his spiritual sense, but he felt the bridge tremble and their surroundings light up, completely enveloping the party. With several shakes, the light brought them to the other end of the bridge.</p><p>At that moment, Han Li was unable to examine the marvelous display of the bridge as he found himself in front of over twenty Flying Spirit Tribe beings. They were all staring at him.</p><p>Behind them, there appeared to be a jade-green hall wrapped in white fog.</p><p>At the very front of this crowd were two people. One of them was a middle-aged man with a large nose and snow-white hair. The other had a wrinkly face and long cheeks, an old man with a black tattoo on his neck.</p><p>When the old woman saw them, she smiled and she walked towards them. As for the rest of them, they joined the crowd.</p><p>The tattooed old man waved his hand with a smile, &ldquo;The elders have brought their holy disciples from a distance away. It must&rsquo;ve been tiring. The holy disciples may rest in the side hall for a spell. The elders may accompany us to the main hall for a chat. The other clan elders are waiting for us there.&rdquo;</p><p>The Chi Rong&rsquo;s Elder Zhu rushed to speak, smiling as he said, &ldquo;Elder Ming is too polite. We&rsquo;ll do as you request.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jin Yue and the young woman from the Pentaluster Race raised no objections.</p><p>With that, Han Li and the others entered the white fog.</p><p>At an unknown time, a slender white-robed woman appeared in front of Han Li and the other holy disciples. She beamed at them and said, &ldquo;Holy disciple, please follow me. This servant shall arrange your residences.&rdquo;</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1433.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1435.html">Next</a></li>

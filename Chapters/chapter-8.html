                                    <p>After a half of a year of extreme cultivation, Han Li at last received Doctor Mo&rsquo;s test.</p><p>Zhang Tie was hopeless compared to Han Li. He had even told Han Li that, over the past six months of cultivation, he couldn&rsquo;t complete even one tenth of the chant.</p><p>Han Li knew that Zhang Tie was not very good with cultivating with this chant. Although he himself couldn&rsquo;t compare to those others with crazy strength, his ability to do hard work and labor was not at all lacking. &nbsp;He had dedicated work habits and was totally assiduous.</p><p>But strangely enough, this chant had no effect at all on Zhang Tie. &nbsp;No matter how much effort he had put, there would be no effect. &nbsp;It looked like there was no chance for Zhang Tie.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s mind was a mess and he could not at all think clearly. &nbsp;He knew that Zhang Tie was ten something years old, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go and pass the test. &nbsp;Han Li had at least some strength; although it wasn&rsquo;t very much, he still had some! What about Zhang Tie who had none? Where would he go?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s utmost effort to cultivate had bore some fruit, for inside of his body flowed some strange energy. &nbsp;If it was compared to before, it was vigorous where as it was previously only a tiny amount. &nbsp;If before it was like a hair, now it was like a piece of cotton yarn. But it wasn&rsquo;t for certain that this amount of energy would make Doctor Mo pass him. &nbsp;So in his heart, he was truly confused and worried.</p><p>&ldquo;Get ready. I will take a look at the fruit of your cultivation.&rdquo; Doctor Mo narrowed his eyes and coldly looked at the two children.</p><p>&ldquo;We are ready.&rdquo; Han Li and Zhang Tie braced themselves as they replied.</p><p>Doctor Mo slowly got up from his chair, and closely held onto the book before putting it &nbsp;on top of the desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Extend your arms out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look at your efforts.&rdquo;</p><p>Doctor Mo grabbed Zhang Tie&rsquo;s arm and checked his pulse. &nbsp;He then placed his hand on top of Zhang Tie&rsquo;s Dantian (TL: Dantian is below the navel)</p><p>He held onto Zhang Tie for the amount of time it takes to drink a cup of tea. &nbsp;Afterwards he let go and stepped back to expressionlessly size up Zhang Tie.</p><p>Zhang Tie&rsquo;s face was very red, and his arms were jittery. &nbsp;When they were released he quickly placed them behind his back. &nbsp;He looked down and did not dare to look at Doctor Mo. &nbsp;He was certain Doctor Mo knew that his efforts with the chant were fruitless. &nbsp;On his face was a resigned look.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re next.&rdquo;</p><p>They were astonished. Doctor Mo had not scolded Zhang Tie at all, and only showed a little bit of disappointment. &nbsp;He had then turned to Han Li.</p><p>Doctor Mo did the same thing to Han Li and checked his right hand&rsquo;s pulse.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent! Coldness, very cold, this is not at all like the hand of a living person.&rdquo; Doctor Mo said excitedly.</p><p>Doctor Mo&rsquo;s hands were dry and covered in calluses. &nbsp;The calluses poked into Han Li&rsquo;s arm and pricked him a little bit. And after Han Li felt the pain from Doctor Mo&rsquo;s grab, he became aware of an odd sensation.</p><p>With the external stimulation, Han Li&rsquo;s energy in his body began to undulate and began to move. &nbsp;It spread out from his eight meridians to his acupuncture points, and from his Dantian to his head and to his four limbs. &nbsp;This all happened at lightning speed and the energy circulated extremely quickly once before returning to his Dantian. &nbsp;Han Li&rsquo;s skin looked a little strange for a moment before it disappeared.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Doctor Mo couldn&rsquo;t help but exclaim in surprise. &nbsp;Apparently he had found the &nbsp;energy inside of Han Li.</p><p>&ldquo;Quick, say the chant one more time,&rdquo; Doctor Mo said. &nbsp;He tried to hide his emotions but couldn&rsquo;t help but light up with joy. &nbsp;In his eyes was an almost fanatical look. &nbsp;But all of this action had stunned Han Li.</p><p>&ldquo;Do it slowly so I can look,&rdquo; &nbsp;Doctor Mo added. &nbsp;Usually he had a cold intonation, but this time he spoke with excitement. Finally Doctor Mo put his hand on top of Han Li&rsquo;s Dantian.</p><p>Han Li felt both of Doctor Mo&rsquo;s hands and shivered a bit. Apparently this was very urgent. So within his body Han Li circulated his energy once.</p><p>&ldquo;Not bad! Not bad! &nbsp;This is the feeling I want. This is the type of feeling! I can&rsquo;t be wrong! There&rsquo;s no way I could be wrong! Haha&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>After Doctor Mo&rsquo;s careful inspection he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh out loud. &nbsp;He grabbed both of Han Li&rsquo;s shoulders and his narrowed eyes opened wide and stared at Han Li. &nbsp;He looked at him like he was looking at a rare treasure and his gaze was almost fanatical.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s ears were filled with the sound of Doctor Mo laughing and his shoulders hurt a little bit from the grab. &nbsp;And again he looked up and saw Doctor Mo&rsquo;s fervent expressions and grew a little bit afraid.</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Very good!&rdquo; Doctor Mo said before looking into Han Li&rsquo;s face. He noticed that within Han Li&rsquo;s eyes there was a bit of fear. &nbsp;Suddenly realizing his feelings, he immediately stopped laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;You must continue to cultivate in the future like you do now. &nbsp;Now you are able to become a disciple of mine.&rdquo; &nbsp;He released Han Li&rsquo;s shoulders and clapped him on the back to encourage him.</p><p>Doctor Mo&rsquo;s expression returned back to normal and regained its previous serenity. It was like his previous fervor had never happened. &nbsp;The only emotion that was left was that occasionally he would glance at Han Li with an excited look. &nbsp;After becoming aware of Han Li&rsquo;s talent he had become quite energized</p><p>&ldquo;As for you&hellip;&rdquo; Doctor Mo looked at Zhang Tie.</p><p>Up until Zhang Tie was stupefied with what was going on. When Doctor Mo shifted the conversation his way he started to pay attention again.</p><p>Thinking of his current situation, Zhang Tie realized that a grim reality was coming before him. &nbsp;So he could only look at Doctor Mo pitifully.</p><p>&ldquo;For you to become my disciple, it will be impossible. With your talent, even if you cultivated for a long time, you would only have a speck of energy. &nbsp;For you to be my disciple, it will be too difficult.&rdquo; Doctor Mo could only shake his head.</p><p>In his heart, Zhang Tie as well could only shake his head, and he could feel his heart sink.</p><p>Upon hearing what Doctor Mo had said, Zhang Tie could only accept his fate.</p><p>But suddenly it felt like Doctor Mo had a certain idea and gazed at Zhang Tie with a baffled look.</p><p>&ldquo;But just now as I inspected you I realized you had something different in your bone roots. &nbsp;I have another method that will be compatible with you. I wonder if you will be willing to follow me.&rdquo; Doctor Mo said. &nbsp;This statement had completely turned the entire previous feeling around as Zhang Tie thought of this idea.</p><p>Upon hearing this Zhang Tie was interested and immediately agreed on the spot.</p><p>&ldquo; Good. Very good. The two of you go back for today. Tomorrow I will teach you a new technique.&rdquo; Considering that Doctor Mo&rsquo;s mood right now was pretty good, he couldn&rsquo;t help but repeat &ldquo;Good. Very good.&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li and Zhang Tie took a quick glance at each other and thought about how today&rsquo;s test was full of unexpected developments. &nbsp;The two of them talked to each other afterwards and both of them felt extremely grateful for what had happened.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-7.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-9.html">Next</a></li>

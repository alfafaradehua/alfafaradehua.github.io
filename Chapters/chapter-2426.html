                                    <h3>Chapter 2426: Might of the Seal</h3><p>At this moment, the nauseating odor of blood and gore swept down from the giant crimson seal, striking everyone with a sense of dizziness and discomfort.</p><p>The fleeing Grand Ascension Stage beings were very alarmed by this, and they immediately released defensive treasures to keep this odor at bay.</p><p>Ming Zun's expression had darkened significantly following the destruction of the Buddhist River Paradise Domain, but he managed to remain calm as he urged, "What are you waiting for, fellow daoists? If you have any trump cards left, now would be the time to use them! If we split up and try to escape, we'll just be hunted down one by one."</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, he opened his mouth to release a pristine white scroll within a burst of five-colored light.</p><p>He then flicked a string of incantation seals toward the scroll, and it slowly unfurled to release countless silver runes that formed a giant silver net before rising up toward the giant seal in the sky.</p><p>The two clashed amid a rumbling boom, and the frail-looking silver net wasn't immediately destroyed. Instead, it managed to slow down the giant seal's descent!</p><p>"That's the Profound Heavenly Treasure, the Great Silver Heavenly Tome!" Yin Gangzi exclaimed upon seeing this.</p><p>A hesitant look then appeared on his face before he gritted his teeth and arrived at a decision.</p><p>All of a sudden, a loud boom rang out within his body, and wisps of silver light surged forth in a frenzy, transforming into a silver giant with long green hair that was several hundred feet tall.</p><p>As soon as the giant appeared, it unleashed countless fist projections toward the crimson seal.</p><p>With each punch that was unleashed, a thunderclap would ring out, as if every attack possessed the power of divine lightning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mistress Wu Ling began to chant an incantation, and a monstrous black projection with a pig's head and an ape's body appeared behind her amid a flash of black light.</p><p>As soon as the projection appeared, it let loose a long roar before opening its mouth, and the entire sky suddenly dimmed as an unfathomably massive mouth emerged above the crimson seal before biting downward, threatening to swallow the entire seal whole.</p><p>The woman in the green palatial dress gritted her teeth before also springing into action, and the attacks unleashed by her were no less fearsome than the others. She raised a hand to summon a giant rainbow ax projection that was over 10,000 feet in length, and the projection slashed directly toward the massive seal without any reservation.</p><p>The other Grand Ascension Stage beings were also unleashing attacks of their own, and it seemed that their attacks were very uncoordinated, but they all reached the crimson seal in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Ma Liang gave a cold harrumph upon seeing this, and he pointed a finger at the giant seal, upon which the blood mist around the seal abruptly shuddered, releasing a series of invisible shockwaves that proliferated outward in all directions.</p><p>All of the oncoming attacks were swept up in the shockwaves, and as a result, the silver net, fist projections, rainbow ax projection, and gargantuan mouth all faltered in mid-air, while the other attacks were reduced to nothingness.</p><p>Even Ming Zun couldn't help but draw a sharp breath at the sight of such a formidable display of power, and he hurriedly opened his mouth to expel a ball of blood essence toward the white scroll before him.</p><p>Around a dozen giant silver runes flew out of the scroll, then transformed into a series of silver light formations of different sizes.</p><p>The light formations overlapped with one another to form a silver pagoda that instantly swelled to around 8,000 feet tall, and the top of the pagoda struck the bottom of the giant seal, upon which the seal was forced upward.</p><p>However, the blood mist around the giant seal immediately surged, and the tip of the light pagoda was crushed, while the pagoda itself was instantly forced down by about 10 feet.</p><p>The tip of the silver pagoda would then instantly regenerate before being shattered again, and the process continued to repeat itself.</p><p>The silver pagoda was clearly no match for the crimson seal, but its interference was causing the seal to slow down drastically in its descent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mistress Wu Ling suddenly exchanged a glance with Yin Gangzi, then made a hand seal, and the black projection appeared behind her again before vanishing into her body in a flash.</p><p>In the next instant, black light surged out of her body, and she swelled to several hundred feet tall, transforming into a pig-ape hybrid beast that was identical to the black projection.</p><p>However, what was different from the projection was that her body had been encased within a suit of grey bone armor, and she was holding a giant yellow sword in each of her two furry hands.</p><p>Mistress Wu Ling let loose a thunderous roar before slashing her giant swords through the air, unleash a pair of massive crescent sword projections that hurtled through the air.</p><p>At the same time, arcs of silver lightning appeared over Yin Gangzi's body before erupting forth at his behest.</p><p>Simultaneously, a dragon's roar rang out, and a five-clawed golden dragon that was over 100 feet in length appeared out of nowhere before pouncing directly toward the golden giant.</p><p>It turned out that the cane-wielding elderly man had hurled his cane through the air, upon which it had transformed into this golden dragon.</p><p>A gargantuan ax projection, countless azure threads, and around a dozen massive ghostly heads were then unleashed by the other Grand Ascension Stage beings in rapid succession, culminating in an extremely fearsome barrage of attacks.</p><p>Ma Liang let loose a thunderous roar upon seeing this, and he took a deep breath before violently exhaling to release a wave of countless golden runes.</p><p>A burst of loud rumbling rang out as a golden tornado took shape in front of him, forming a golden wind barrier that stretched all the way up into the heavens.</p><p>The yellow sword projections, silver lightning, and golden dragon were all instantly destroyed as soon as they entered the wind barrier. As for the rest of the attacks, they weren't even able to make it to the golden wind barrier as they had been kept at bay by a burst of invisible force and could only revolve incessantly on the spot.</p><p>All of the Grand Ascension Stage beings were struck by a sense of despair upon seeing this.</p><p>All of a sudden, Ming Zun turned toward a certain direction with a cold expression, and asked, "Fellow daoists, why have you remained inactive this entire time? Are you planning to break your contract?"</p><p>Spatial fluctuations erupted in that direction, and four black-armored young men who bore a strong resemblance with one another emerged, following which one of them replied, "You never told us that we had to face a true immortal, Brother Ming."</p><p>Judging from their auras, these four young men were the human forms of the four Mythical Black Beasts, who had concealed themselves into space right after Mal Liang completed his transformation.</p><p>"None of the terms of your contract state that you can back down just because the enemy is a true immortal. Otherwise, our trade guild wouldn't have expended such a heavy price for this contract. Aren't you afraid that you'll suffer backlash from breaking the contract and have your cultivation bases severely debilitated?" Ming Zun asked in a cold voice.</p><p>"Hmph, at least that would be better than ending up dead!" the leader of the black-armored young men retorted.</p><p> Ming Zun suddenly switched to voice transmission here, and said, "I never said that you had to give your lives for this cause. How about this? All I need is for the four of you to unleash an all-out with your bonded true flames. After you do that, you'll have completed your contract, and I'll let you leave this realm."</p><p>The black-armored young man faltered slightly upon hearing this before a hint of skepticism appeared in his eyes. "Is that true?"</p><p>"I wouldn't lie about something like this; I'm willing to swear an inner demon vow," Ming Zun replied.</p><p>The black-armored young man exchanged a few glances with his companions before nodding in response. "In that case, we can assist you one more time, and there's no need for you to swear a vow. However, regardless of the outcome, we'll immediately leave after unleashing one final attack."</p><p>Ming Zun's expression eased slightly upon hearing this, and he said, "Alright, please pay attention and strike when I tell you to do so."</p><p>During their conversation, Ma Liang had begun chanting another incantation, and crimson light flashed from his glabella, upon which a drop of golden blood essence emerged before flying into the crimson seal as a streak of golden light.</p><p>A burst of loud rumbling rang out as the crimson mist around the giant seal parted, and countless crimson light threads numbering in the millions instantly tore through space and shot forth in all directions.</p><p>Ming Zun was very alarmed to see this, and he hurriedly pointed a finger at his silver scroll, which immediately transformed into a silver light barrier around himself, as well as Mistress Wu Ling, Yin Gangzi, and the woman in the palatial dress.</p><p>The other Grand Ascension Stage beings' expressions changed drastically upon seeing this, and it was too late for them to fly into Ming Zun's light barrier, so they could only inject their magic power into their own protective treasures with all their might.</p><p>The crimson threads flew through the air like lightning, and several agonized wails rang out in unison.</p><p>The silver pagoda was also instantly riddled with holes, looking as if it could collapse at any moment. Furthermore, the crimson threads were able to pierce through everyone's defensive treasures and protective spiritual light with ease, punching countless small holes into their bodies.</p><p>Bursts of crimson flames then abruptly erupted out of those holes, instantly incinerating them into nothingness, and even their Nascent Souls had been unable to escape. </p><p>

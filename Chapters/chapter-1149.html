                                    <p>He spread open his fingers and a golden lightning wyrm shot forth from his arm, clashing directly with the oncoming black python.</p><p>"Divine Devilbane Lightning!"</p><p>Zenith Yin's heart jolted with shock upon seeing this. He immediately tried to make another hand seal, but it was already too late.</p><p>The golden wyrm threw itself at the black python, creating a resounding boom.</p><p>Golden light flashed and the black python's body was enshrouded by countless arcs of golden lightning before being reduced to nothingness in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Divine Devilbane Lightning's efficacy against devilish Qi was no joke.</p><p>A hint of rage appeared on Zenith Yin's face as he patted the storage pouch hanging from his waist.</p><p>A loud cry erupted as a streak of crimson light around a foot in length shot forth from the storage pouch. It flashed through the air before arriving directly above Han Li's head, where it transformed into a long crimson saber and came crashing downward.</p><p>Before the saber had even begun its descent, the pungent odor of blood and gore came rushing toward Han Li first.</p><p>Han Li's expression darkened as he tilted his head back and abruptly opened his mouth, sending a small golden sword flying upward.</p><p>A loud clang rang out as golden and crimson light became interwoven with one another. The crimson saber then let loose a cry of anguish before being sliced in half by the golden flying sword, following which its two halves came plummeting straight down toward the ground. "Impossible!"</p><p>Zenith Yin's expression changed drastically upon seeing this and the ecstasy that was clouding his judgment was immediately dispelled.</p><p>Within the stone chamber, the restriction on one's spiritual sense didn't have any effect, so he immediately sent his spiritual sense sweeping toward Han Li. </p><p>In Han Li's eyes, Zenith Yin was already a dead man, so there was no need for him to hide his cultivation base. As such, he circulated his magic power with reckless abandon throughout his body.</p><p>After detecting Han Li's cultivation base, a series of spectacular expressions flashed through Zenith Yin's face.</p><p>He initially faltered before a confused look appeared on his face, followed by incredulity and a hint of horror. When he used his spiritual sense to verify Han Li's cultivation base again, his face immediately turned deathly pale.</p><p>"You've already reached the late-Nascent Soul Stage?"</p><p>Zenith Yin spat through gritted teeth as his entire body instantly became drenched in cold sweat!</p><p>Han Li began to recall events of the past and intense killing intent welled up in his heart as he said in a cold voice, "Hmph, what good will that knowledge do you? It's actually better to die as a fool. Seeing as you pursued me relentlessly to try and take my Heavenvoid Cauldron, it's only fitting that I kill you with this cauldron."</p><p>He then opened his mouth and a ball of azure light shot forth, spinning on the spot before revealing itself to be a small antiquated cauldron.</p><p>It was none other than the Heavenvoid Cauldron!</p><p>Zenith Yin was astonished by the fact that Han Li had progressed to the late-Nascent Soul Stage and even now, he still felt as if he were in a dream. However, he knew that he was in an extremely perilous situation after witnessing Han Li summon the Heavenvoid Cauldron, and he certainly wasn't going to surrender.</p><p>Thus, he gritted his teeth and abruptly spun on the spot. Bursts of inky-black Yin Qi exuded from his body, encompassing most of the stone chamber in the blink of an eye. At the same time, intimidating ghostly figures began to emerge in the black mist amid bursts of ghastly screeching.</p><p>Zenith Yin unleashed his Profound Yin Devilish Arts with all his might, while also releasing the 18 Heavenwide Corpses that he had been refining for several centuries. However, he didn't dare to attack Han Li with devilish Qi, which made him rather hesitant with regard to how to proceed. </p><p>In response, Han Li merely chuckled coldly.</p><p>Even though almost the entire stone chamber had been enshrouded in Profound Yin Devilish Qi, he could still see everything with great clarity using his spirit eyes.</p><p>Thus, he didn't waste any time with words as a pointed a finger toward the Heavenvoid Cauldron in front of him.</p><p>Azure light flashed over the surface of the cauldron as clumps of azure threads shot forth. There seemed to be no end to the azure threads and they formed a massive azure net in the blink of an eye before hovering in the air.</p><p>Zenith Yin's heart sank upon seeing this and he immediately began to chant an incantation.</p><p>The devilish projections nearby flashed and 18 Heavenwide Corpses rushed out of the cloud of Yin Qi, heading directly upward while flailing their arms in an attempt to tear through the azure net.</p><p>Han Li looked on expressionlessly as he flicked a finger toward the small cauldron before him.</p><p>A faint clang rang out and dazzling light suddenly erupted from the azure net. A layer of blue glacial flames abruptly appeared beneath the net before transforming into a dozen or so shiny blue fire-birds, all of which flew toward the oncoming corpses.</p><p>The Heavenwide Corpses didn't even get the chance to utter a single sound before they were reduced to 18 sinister ice sculptures by the blue flames. The ice sculptures then fell from above and were shattered into countless pieces.</p><p>At this moment, the threads on the azure net suddenly shuddered as countless fist-sized blue fireballs hurtled toward the devilish QI down below. The black mist tumbled and surged violently before transforming into countless black pythons that rose up to meet the descending fireballs.</p><p>As soon as the two came into contact with one another, the blue fireballs exploded on impact, sending a vast expanse of blue glacial mist spreading through the entire stone chamber.</p><p>The temperatures in the stone chamber immediately plummeted as thick layers of ice materialized on the walls, floor, and ceiling.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the stone chamber had been completely transformed into a glacial realm.</p><p>The black pythons were powerless in the face of the blue glacial mist and were reduced to countless ice sculptures, which then crumbled into countless fragments. The might of the blue glacial mist then vanquished all of the remaining devilish Qi, revealing the indistinct figure of Zenith Yin underneath. Under such circumstances, Zenith Yin definitely wouldn't be able to last long at all.</p><p>He was also aware of this himself and he immediately let loose a shrill cry and he blasted an inky-black bead out of his mouth.</p><p>As soon as the bead emerged, Zenith Yin bit through the tip of his tongue and threw up a mouthful of blood essence onto the bead.</p><p>The bead immediately shuddered before transforming into a ball of devilish flames. The fireball revolved in a circle around Zenith Yin before transforming into a layer of pitch-black flames that enshrouded him within.</p><p>This was none other than Zenith Yin's trump card, his Heavenwide Corpsefire.</p><p>After unleashing these flames, Zenith Yin's confidence was restored slightly. He swept up his remaining devilish Qi before transforming into a ball of black flames and rushing toward the entrance of the stone chamber, appearing as if he were fleeing for his life.</p><p>The Heavenwide Corpsefire really was a force to be reckoned with; after coming into contact with these flames, the blue glacial mist emitted a dull thump and was unable to freeze Zenith Yin. After a few flashes, he managed to fly out of the blue glacial mist and instantly appeared near the entrance.</p><p>Han Li's expression remained unchanged upon seeing this, but he internally activated his Artifact Imprint Technique.</p><p>Azure light suddenly erupted from the stone gate as countless azure threads shot forth from the nearby walls, interweaving with one another to create an impenetrable net.</p><p>"Argh!" Zenith Yin's heart sank upon seeing this.</p><p>Right at this moment, a frosty sensation suddenly surged toward him from above and he looked up in shock and horror.</p><p>A massive ice lotus was materializing overhead above the azure net. The lotus was entirely blue in color and extremely vibrant and beautiful. More importantly, it was encompassing Zenith Yin's entire body beneath it.</p><p>"Crap!" A wave of shock surged through Zenith Yin's heart as he attempted to rush out of the lotus flower's range.</p><p>However, right at this moment, two clumps of azure threads suddenly erupted from the ground upon which he was standing, binding themselves tightly around his feet.</p><p>As a result, Zenith Yin was completely unable to escape. The azure threads continued up his calves, ensnaring his entire body in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The black flames were still raging over his body, yet the threads were seemingly completely immune to this fire.</p><p>Almost at the exact same moment, the blue ice lotus up above began to slowly descend.</p><p>Zenith Yin was absolutely petrified upon seeing this.</p><p>His Heavenwide Corpsefire was indeed quite powerful, but there was no way it would be able to withstand the might of the Celestial Blue Flames.</p><p>IN this dire situation, he opened his mouth and expelled a black jade pendant.</p><p>However, before he could unleash the power of this treasure, more clumps of azure threads shot forth toward him from nearby.</p><p>The small ade pendant was ensnared in a flash.</p><p>Zenith Yin's heart jolted with shock and he hurriedly attempted to activate the jade pendant with his spiritual sense.</p><p>However, the azure threads around the pendant merely flashed and his connection with the treasure was severed.</p><p>The azure threads then dragged the jade pendant toward the Heavenvoid Cauldron.</p><p>The threads and the jade pendant flashed and both were absorbed into the cauldron.</p><p>An expression of despair appeared on Zenith Yin's face upon seeing this.</p><p>He was unleashing his Heavenwide Corpsefire with all his might and summoned two other treasures to keep the ice lotus overhead at bay, but his struggles were ultimately proving to be futile.</p><p>As soon as the blue ice lotus began to descend, a layer of blue flames erupted with the lotus at the very center.</p><p>As soon as Zenith Yin's Heavenwide Corpsefire came into contact with the Celestial Ice Flames, the former was immediately warped and crushed. Following a string of loud bangs, the Heavenwide Corpsefire was reduced to a pitiful state and appeared to be on the verge of being snuffed out.</p><p>During this period of time, Zenith Yin unleashed several secret techniques in quick succession to try and struggle free from the azure threads binding his body, all to no avail.</p><p>When the final wisp of Heavenwide Corpsefire was snuffed out, the blue lotus flower finally descended.</p><p>Despite Zenith Yin's desperate struggles, he was completely enshrouded in glacial power and completely frozen solid. His entire body was encapsulated in a block of blue ice that was several tens of feet tall, and an expression of shock and horror still lingered on his face.</p><p>From the commencement of the battle all the way until Zenith Yin was captured, Han Li didn't use any treasure other than the Heavenvoid Cauldron, and he didn't even move a single step from where he was standing. After Zenith Yin was sealed in ice, Han Li chuckled coldly as he flicked a finger toward the cauldron again.</p><p>All of the azure threads in the stone chamber tremored in unison before returning to the cauldron as streaks of light, while spiritual light flashed incessantly over the surface of the cauldron.</p><p>Han Li immediately opened is mouth upon seeing this to swallow the cauldron back into his stomach. He then turned his attention to Zenith Yin, who was trapped in the block of blue ice, and he chuckled as a hint of a smile appeared on his face. However, his eyes were extremely cold and completely devoid of emotion.</p><p>Han Li drifted over to the blue ice sculpture and a ringing sound erupted from his sleeve as a dozen or so golden flying swords shot forth. The flying swords circled through the air before elongating to several feet in length. They then aimed their sharp tips at the blue ice sculpture from all directions, appearing as if they were going to completely dismember Zenith Yin's body.</p><p>"Please wait, Fellow Daoist Han! My entire family was slaughtered by this man. May I have the honor of putting an end to this man's life?" A voice that was familiar to Han Li suddenly sounded from a corner of the stone chamber.</p><p>Han Li stirred as he arrested the momentum of his flying sword and turned toward the source of the voice.</p><p>Golden light suddenly shimmered beneath a thick layer of ice as a small fist smashed its way through the ice, causing the ice to shatter.</p><p>A golden Nascent Soul emerged from within the ice before rising into the air and looking directly at Han Li.</p><p>

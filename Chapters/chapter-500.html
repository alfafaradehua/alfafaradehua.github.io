                                    <p><strong>Chapter 500: The Starfall Coalition</strong></p><p>Han Li spoke with an indifferent expression, &ldquo;What great event? I only left seclusion a few days ago. Tell me about it!&rdquo;</p><p>The old man locked his fingers together and spoke carefully, &ldquo;It is only natural for Junior to answer Senior&rsquo;s questions. However, may I ask for your name?&rdquo;</p><p>After he heard this, Han Li felt somewhat surprised. After he tilted his head and pondered for a moment, he mysteriously smiled and said, &ldquo;It seems that you&rsquo;re being quite careful. I am the Exquisite Sound Sect&rsquo;s Guest Elder Han. Have you heard of me before?&rdquo;</p><p>After he heard of Han Li&rsquo;s identity, he let out a long sigh of relief and smiled, &ldquo;So it turns out to be Elder Han. You can&rsquo;t be considered an outsider then. Our own sect&rsquo;s Fairy Xuedi is close friends with Sect Master Fairy Violet Spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li was surprised at his claim that they were on the same side and couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s laugh caused the old man to grow somewhat uneasy.</p><p>&lsquo;Did I say something wrong?&rsquo; The old man thought apprehensively.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s smile disappeared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t involve myself in the matters of the sect, nor do I care if you are lying. All I want is for you to properly answer my question. I won&rsquo;t make things difficult for you. What major event occurred recently?&rdquo;</p><p>The old man pledged he was speaking the truth with smile, &ldquo;How could I deceive you, Senior? All of my words are true&hellip;&rdquo;, but when Han Li&rsquo;s gaze grew icy, he immediately started his explanation, &ldquo;There were rumors that had suddenly emerged recently in the Scattered Star Seas that the Heavenly Star Sages were on the verge of breaking through to the great success stage of Divine Essencefused Light. The star palace took advantage of this opportunity to start eliminating certain disobedient or uncontrollable powers. This was originally believed to only be a rumor, but not longer after this rumor was spread, the Star Palace issued an official command to powers of all sizes to have their sect leaders and island lords immediately come to Heavenly Star City and pay audience to the Heavenly Star Sages. Otherwise, they will be branded as traitors and be eliminated.&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li blinked before speaking with disbelief, &ldquo;Have every power pay audience to the Heavenly Star Sages? Did I hear correctly? The Star Palace gave such an obviously insidious command?&rdquo;</p><p>The old man bitterly smiled, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The official command stunned many powers upon arrival. Were this at the peak of the Star Palace&rsquo;s power, there would be no problem with this order. But as of current, it would be surprising for the the powers of the Righteous and Devil Dao to obey.&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li swept his gaze past the group and frowned, asking,&ldquo;Then all of the cultivators I saw on the way were heading towards Heavenly Star City to pay audience to the Heavenly Star Sages?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say!&rdquo; The old man appeared hesitant.</p><p>A strange expression appeared on Han Li&rsquo;s face. He curiously asked, &ldquo;Hard to say? What does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p>The old man continued with a helpless expression, &ldquo;Senior, there are some things I still haven&rsquo;t said. Soon after the Heavenly Star Palace issued the command, the Righteous and Devilish Dao suddenly formed the Starfall Coalition, in proclamation of smashing apart the Star Palace&rsquo;s hegemony in the Scattered Star Seas and ending their reign. The Righteous Dao has dispatched their enforcement elder Wan Sangu and the Devil Dao dispatched their towering hero, the Archsaint of the Six Paths, as the two leaders of Starfall Coalition. After the alliance was established, many sects belonging to the Righteous and Devilish Dao began joining under their banner. Unaffiliated powers have also joined them, and several tens of rogue Nascent Soul paragons have been appointed as elders in the alliance. In addition, the Starfall Coalition copied the Star Palace and made their own proclamation with what is known as the Starfall Coalition&rsquo;s Ghost Crest, proclaiming that any power to respond to the Star Palace will be branded as their enemy without exception. In addition, they claim that they will soon be launching an attack on Heavenly Star City and welcome all powers to witness the battle, and make their allegiances clear.&rdquo;</p><p>Having heard this, Han Li&rsquo;s expression remained completely indifferent, but his mind was left in a daze. This was beyond imagination! Such a massive event had occurred in the short time he had been stuck in Heavenvoid Hall!</p><p>For some time, Han Li was at a loss, but his mind suddenly stirred and he calmly gazed at the old man, asking, &ldquo;What is the Starfall Coalition&rsquo;s Ghost Crest? Do you have it on hand?&rdquo;</p><p>The old man was stunned for a moment before enthusiastically replying, &ldquo;It is in my sect master&rsquo;s possession, but if Senior desires, I have a record of it on a jade slip that I can show him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Let&rsquo;s see it!&rdquo; Han Li nodded with an indifferent expression.</p><p>The old man immediately searched his storage pouch for a yellow jade slip and hastily handed it over to Han Li.</p><p>Han Li bluntly took it and quickly immersed his spiritual sense into it. A second later, he felt shocked!</p><p>The crest appeared to be the same as the ghost head that the Six United Palaces&rsquo; Elder showed Wu Chou long ago. Although there were slight differences in appearance, it held a near exact resemblance. It seemed that the Righteous and Devil Dao had long colluded in secret, infiltrating other powers for many years with meticulous care.</p><p>Han Li was amazed and expressionlessly returned the jade slip to the old man.</p><p>Han Li casually said, &ldquo;Since that is the case, you must be drawing close to Heavenly Star City so that you may observe the results of the battle and come to a decision afterwards.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man revealed a trace of embarrassment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Senior. Under the command of our Sect Master, we are to head over and examine the situation. After all, our Three Immortals Sect isn&rsquo;t a large organization, and can only choose to be pragmatic. However, in this short amount of time, Starfall Coalition has already launched an attack on the Outer Star Islands and has successfully taken them over. There were even islands that defected to the Starfall Coalition. It seem that the Inner Star Islands will soon be attacked as well. There are also a few scoundrels that have taken advantage of the situation to stir up havoc. Many rogue cultivators have ended up dead in the wilderness and no small number of small sects have ended up thoroughly exterminated.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s worrying words explained why so many cultivators had been so cautious as they traveled.</p><p>Han Li was very satisfied with the old man&rsquo;s answer and calmly said, &ldquo;So it was like that. Alright, since you have answered my questions, you may leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then us Juniors will hastily set off.&rdquo; The old man rejoiced at Han Li&rsquo;s words and respectfully said his farewells before hastily leading the group away.</p><p>Although he saw that Han Li wasn&rsquo;t an evil and vicious character, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel apprehensive in the presence of an unfamiliar Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Han Li stood motionlessly in place as he muttered to himself.</p><p>A huge war has erupted between the Star Palace and the alliance of the Righteous and Devilish Dao. On the bright side, this war would certainly take up the Nascent Soul eccentrics&rsquo; attention. As they were aligned to either side, it would be impossible for them to avoid participating in the war. As such, he would be far safer as they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to dedicate their time to tracking him or the Heavenvoid Cauldron down.</p><p>Conversely, the war would make it rather troublesome for him to return to Heavenly Star City. At the very least, the cultivators entering the city would be thoroughly inspected, especially a Core Formation cultivator such as himself. Furthermore, if a battle were to erupt in the city before he returned, he would be unable to enter. The Star Palace would likely bar any cultivators from entering during that time.</p><p>With that thought, he let out a sigh.</p><p>In the following few days, he intercepted several more low level cultivators and asked them the same questions, only to receive similar answers.</p><p>As a result, Han Li was now floating above the sea, blankly staring off into the distance with a face of hesitation.</p><p>He raised his head to look at the blue sky and flipped his hand, causing a small azure bottle to appear.</p><p>Han Li helplessly looked at the small bottle. Using the Myriad Year Spirit Milk so soon seemed like an immense waste, but if he didn&rsquo;t hurry, the Starfall Coalition would launch an attack. His plans of entering Heavenly Star City and escaping to the Outer Star Seas through their transportation formations would then become null.</p><p>After a long while of contemplation, Han Li eventually opened the bottle with gritted teeth and carefully poured several drops of thick, transparent liquid into his mouth.</p><p>Afterwards, he placed the bottle away and put on his blood-red cloak before suddenly shooting through the sky and disappearing from sight. Half a month later, when Han Li had nearly exhausted his magic power, he took another few drops of spirit milk and continued to hurry on his way through the use of the blood-red cape. As a result, Han Li was able to travel at a speed similar to that of common Nascent Soul cultivators, and greatly reduced his travel time.</p><p>Along the way, the few Core Formation cultivators that he came across had mistaken Han Li to be a Nascent Soul expert and steered clear of his path.</p><p>As expected, there weren&rsquo;t any cultivators that dared to even think of bothering a Nascent Soul expert.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-499.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-501.html">Next</a></li>

                                    <p>A pained look appeared on Fairy Silver Light's face, and she immediately opened her mouth to expel a small silver sword.</p><p>The flying sword flew over to her shoulder as a streak of silver light, then abruptly sliced off her arm. Strangely enough, not a single drop of blood flowed out of the self-inflicted wound.</p><p>As soon as the arm was detached from her body, it burst into crimson flames and was quickly incinerated into ashes.</p><p>"Be careful, Brother Han; this is one of the four great devilish flames of the Elder Devil Race, the Blood Eroding Devilish Flame! Once it enters a target's body, there's no way it can be expelled aside from through the use of several types of legendary treasures," Fairy Silver Light cautioned in an urgent voice.</p><p>She then flipped her remaining hand over to produce a fragrant white pill amid a flash of azure light, then swallowed the pill without any hesitation.</p><p>A burst of azure light immediately revolved around the cross-section of the wound on her shoulder, and another arm that was identical to the severed one appeared.</p><p>However, her complexion had paled significantly behind her mask, and it was quite clear that she had paid quite a heavy price to instantaneously regenerate that lost limb.</p><p>Han Li glanced at Fairy Silver Light's new arm, then turned back to the mountainous Lord Li, and a hint of killing intent flashed through his eyes. "Blood Eroding Devilish Flames? I see, it looks like I underestimated you. But then again, this is a good thing; it shows that you're definitely quite an important figure in the Elder Devil Race, which gives me even more incentive to kill you."</p><p>"You think the two of you can kill me?" Lord Li guffawed in a disdainful manner. He then abruptly swept his giant black staff through the air, and countless mountainous staff projections took shape amid a string of rumbling booms, then swept toward Han Li and Fairy Silver Light with devastating force.</p><p>Before the staff projections had even reached them, both of them were struck by a burst of suffocating spiritual pressure, as if heaven and earth were about to crumble around them.</p><p>"Hmph, it seems that you're very confident in your own strength." As opposed to being alarmed by the situation, a cold light flashed through Han Li's eyes, and his body abruptly swelled drastically in size amid a flash of golden light.</p><p>Within the span of just a single breath, he had transformed into an enormous golden ape. He made a grabbing motion with both hands, and a black mountain and an azure mountain appeared in his grasp. He then raised both mountains high up into the air, upon which they expanded to several thousand feet tall and kept all of the oncoming staff projections at bay.</p><p>The staff projections unleashed by Lord Li were also extremely powerful, and they struck the two mountains amid a rapid string of resounding booms, but after the projections faded, the mountains were revealed again, having sustained no damage aside from some small pits and bumps.</p><p>Incredulous looks appeared on all three of Lord Li's faces upon seeing this, and he exclaimed, "Impossible! How could there possibly be a Body Integration Stage human cultivator with strength superior to mine? "</p><p>He turned to inspect the giant ape that Han Li transformed into, and the astonishment in his eyes grew even more pronounced.</p><p>"Hehe, it would be rude of me not to return the favor; how about you take an attack from me as well?" the golden ape chuckled coldly before abruptly bringing the two massive mountains together, then hurled them with devastating force.</p><p>Two resounding booms rang out as the pair of mountains hurtled through the air, leaving two white trails in their wake. Even when they were still a few hundred feet away from Lord Li, a burst of enormous invisible force had weighed down upon him, causing the space around him to tremor violently as if it were on the brink of being shattered.</p><p>Lord Li was extremely alarmed to see this, but he refused to believe that he would lose to Han Li in a contest of strength. As such, all three of his heads let loose ferocious roars, and he swept his giant black staff toward the two mountains, sending countless staff projections hurtling through the air once again.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom erupted, and Lord Li's hands instantly went numb as his giant staff was wrenched out of his grasp. At the same time, a burst of tremendous force crashed into his body, sending him flying back as he threw up a mouthful of black blood.</p><p>The two giant mountains only faltered momentarily in mid-air before crashing down with devastating force again, threatening to crush Lord Li into mincemeat.</p><p>An expression of shock and fury appeared on Lord Li's face, and his six arms suddenly detached from his body on their own, then transformed into a cloud of blood mist around him.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, the two giant mountains also slammed into the blood mist, but Lord Li was already nowhere to be seen, clearly having escaped using some kind of movement technique.</p><p>Han Li faltered slightly upon seeing this before a furious look appeared in his eyes. He thumped his own chest violently as an inky-black vertical eye appeared on his glabella, and as soon as it emerged, a pillar of black light that was as thick as a large bowl erupted from it.</p><p>The pillar of black light then instantly vanished into thin air, and in the next instant, a rumbling boom erupted several thousand feet away.</p><p>An alarmed roar rang out, and spatial fluctuations erupted as the mountainous Lord Li stumbled out of thin air. Han Li immediately pointed to his two mountains in the distance without any hesitation upon seeing this, and the pair of mountains shuddered in response.</p><p>Silver runes flashed on the surface of one of the mountains as it released a burst of grey light, while the other released scintillating azure light that transformed into countless streaks of invisible sword Qi.</p><p>The two intertwined with one another, and even heaven and earth tremored in the face of Han Li's wrath.</p><p>Lord Li's faces immediately paled upon seeing this, and he stomped both of his feet onto the space below him without any hesitation. His feet then exploded into two bursts of blood mist as well, revealing a pair of silver foot bones.</p><p>Not only were these foot bones flashing with silver light, there was also a pair of crimson talismans adhered to their surfaces.</p><p>Lord Li's three heads then began to chant a strange incantation in unison, and the two crimson talismans spontaneously combusted. A dozen or so large crimson runes were imprinted onto the foot bones in a flash, following which the foot bones transformed into a pair of silver flying wheels amid a flash of spiritual light.</p><p>Crimson devilish flames erupted over the surface of the flying wheels, and they began to rotate at a rapid speed, transforming the devilish lord into a streak of crimson light that hurtled away into the distance.</p><p>The wheels were traveling so quickly that they covered a distance of over 10,000 feet in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Lord Li had decided to flee the scene as soon as he realized that he was no match for Han Li. Han Li naturally faltered slightly upon seeing this, and his brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>This Lord Li seemed to be determined to battle Han Li to the death and even unleashed his Elder Devil Avatar, yet now, he was fleeing the scene at the first sign of trouble, and that was truly very unexpected.</p><p>Only the span of a few breaths had passed since Han Li had transformed into his Giant Mountain Ape form, and Fairy Silver Light took advantage of this opportunity to catch her breath and recover somewhat from her expenditure.</p><p>She was elated to see that Han Li was overwhelming their opponent, but at the same time, she hurriedly yelled, "Brother Han, we can't allow him to escape; if he finds other devilish beings and comes back, then we'll be in big trouble!"</p><p>As soon as her voice trailed off, she pointed a finger at her pair of silver hooks and stowed them away up her sleeve. She then raised a hand to summon a green flying shuttle, which she immediately flew into without any hesitation.</p><p>A resounding boom rang out, and the shuttle shot forth through the air as a streak of green light that was traveling no slower than the streak of crimson light in the distance.</p><p>"That's a spirit treasure on the Chaotic Myriad Spirit Roll, the Celestial Green Shuttle! I didn't think that she'd be in possession of such a treasure," Han Li murmured to himself in a rather surprised manner before a cold smile appeared on his face. "Of course, there's no way I'd let that old devil get away!"</p><p>Immediately thereafter, he made a hand seal, and his giant ape body was suddenly enshrouded in a layer of silver light. A clear cry then rang out, and a giant silver bird that was over 1,000 feet in length appeared in the place of the giant golden ape.</p><p>The giant bird raised its head and flapped its wings, and arcs of silver lightning erupted from its body as another pair of translucent wings also appeared on its back.</p><p>These were none other than Han Li's Thunderstorm Wings!</p><p>As such, the giant bird now had two pairs of massive wings.</p><p>This integration of the Tian Peng Transformation and the Thunderstorm Wings was an extreme movement technique that Han Li had developed over the past few centuries.</p><p>The giant silver bird flapped all four of its wings in unison and instantly vanished on the spot as a bolt of lightning, leaving a trail of thunderclaps in its wake that were becoming more and more distant.</p><p>At this point, the streak of crimson light was already several tens of kilometers away. Within the crimson light, Lord Li was relentlessly pouring his energy into the silver wheels beneath him while frantically looking around with an urgent expression.</p><p>Prior to catching up to Han Li's duo, he had communicated with his two companions again. At the time, those two devilish lords were already quite close to him, and that was why he had dared to engage two Body Integration Stage beings in battle on his own.</p><p>However, never did he think that the male human cultivator who had killed his grandson would be this powerful. However, that wasn't too much of an issue; he hadn't unleashed his most powerful trump card, either, and he would be able to launch a counterattack once his companions joined him.</p><p>As such, he would still have an opportunity to kill those two human cultivators.</p><p>With that in mind, Lord Li forcibly repressed the fury in his heart and began to chant something as he flew. Plumes of blood mist erupted from the wounds on his shoulders, and the flesh there squirmed and writhed incessantly. Moments later, all six of his dismembered arms had fully regenerated.</p><p>Right at this moment, a male voice suddenly sounded beside his ears. "Why are you in such a sorry state, Brother Li? Are those two human cultivators that difficult to deal with? Rest assured, we've already set up a temporary devilish formation nearby; all you have to do is lure the two of them into the formation, and we'll definitely be able to kill them together!"</p><p>The voice belonged to none other than that bald devilish being!</p><p>

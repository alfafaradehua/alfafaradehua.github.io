<h1>chapter-2294</h1>

<p>"It's not that easy; I've only grasped the basics. There's no way I can face a Grand Ascension Stage being on my own, so I'll be requiring your assistance, Senior Yi," Ying'er replied with a smile.

The brocade-robed man examined his own body to find that even some of his expended energy had been recovered, and he was naturally ecstatic. "Hehe, you've even mastered Spirit Reversal; I think that's more than just the basics. With your assistance, I wouldn't mind engaging that man in battle again."

Immediately thereafter, he transformed into his peacock-human hybrid form again, then flipped his hands over to produce a ball of silver light and a ball of golden light, which contained the silver scroll and golden mirror, respectively.

The scroll in his hand blurred before exploding into countless silver runes, forming a suit of silver armor that encased his entire body.

As for the golden mirror, it glowed with scintillating light before transforming into a pair of giant golden swords, which he immediately grabbed onto.

Meanwhile, Ying'er made a hand seal, and the wolf-headed beasts before her exploded amid a dull thump, then surged into her body as two bursts of crimson mist.

Her hands immediately began to glow with crimson light, and she chanted something while pointing a finger toward the brocade-robed man several times in succession.

A string of runes emerged from her fingertip before vanishing into his silver armor in a flash, and a layer of crimson patterns instantly appeared on the surface of the armor.

At the same time, the brocade-robed man felt a burst of heat surge through his body. His strength had been enhanced by around twofold, and a burst of violent rage welled up in his heart as his eyes became noticeably more bloodshot.

"So you've cast a Bloodlust Technique on me, eh? That suits me just fine!" he chortled as he hurtled out of the light barrier as a ball of golden light, then swept his swords through the air to unleash two massive sword projections, each of which was over 1,000 feet in length.The sword projections swept through the air with devastating force, but a smile suddenly appeared on Han Li's face as he appraised the sword projections, then took a glance at Ying'er.

He pointed a finger up into the sky, and the three extreme mountains abruptly vanished on the spot.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted before him, and the three extreme mountains appeared right in front of his body.

A resounding boom rang out as the two golden sword projections viciously struck the extreme mountains, only to be repelled while the mountains merely tremored slightly.

A cold look flashed through the brocade-robed man's eyes upon seeing this, and he hurled both of his giant golden swords upward in unison before chanting an incantation.

All of a sudden, the two swords fused as one amid a flash of scintillating golden light, then came crashing down with even more ferocious power.

Han Li harrumphed coldly upon seeing this, then made a hand seal with each of his six hands. 72 small azure swords flew out of his body, transforming into countless streaks of sword Qi that also fused as one to form a giant blade several thousand feet in length.

The massive blade was sent hurtling through the air at Han Li's behest, and the two giant blades clashed amid a deafening boom.

Dazzling golden and azure light illuminated the entire sky, forcing one to avert their gaze.

The two massive blades seemed to be evenly matched.

The brocade-robed man's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this, and he pointed a finger toward his blade in rapid succession, injecting his magic power into the sword from afar.

The golden light radiating from the sword instantly became far brighter, but at the same time, Han Li raised his three heads and opened his mouths to release three bolts of golden lightning, all of which vanished into thin air in a flash.

In the next instant, countless arcs of lightning emerged from the surface of the giant azure sword, then surged directly toward the golden sword.

In the face of the azure sword and golden lightning, the golden sword was instantly shattered, much to the brocade-robed man's surprise.

Right at this moment, a fierce look appeared in Han Li's eyes, and he took a step forward without any hesitation, upon which he suddenly disappeared.

The brocade-robed man's heart jolted upon seeing this, and he hurriedly called out to Ying'er while making a hand seal to summon eight five-colored shields amid a flash of five-colored light.

The shields protected him from all directions, while he flipped a hand over to summon a purplish-black wooden ruler, which transformed into a projection in his hand.

A faint smile appeared on Ying'er's face upon hearing the brocade-robed man's cry for assistance, and she thrust a hand forward, upon which one of the wolf-headed beasts around her instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist, within which a giant wolf's head could be seen.

Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted beside the brocade-robed man, and a golden figure emerged before pouncing toward him like lightning.

The brocade-robed man harrumphed coldly upon seeing this, and he glided backward while unleashing countless streaks of purple light with the wooden ruler in his hand.

However, the golden figure made no attempt to evade the streaks of purple light and continued to charge ahead with single-minded ferocity.

The streaks of purple light struck the golden figure, and most of them were repelled, while only a small proportion of them managed to plunge into the golden figure's body.

A rank odor immediately wafted through the air, and the golden figure was stalled slightly.

A hint of elation appeared on the brocade-robed man's face upon seeing this.

The streaks of purple light didn't appear to be all that remarkable, but they were incredibly sharp and infused with spiritual sense disrupting compounds that would severely affect even a Grand Ascension Stage being.

This was one of his greatest trump cards.

However, much to the brocade-robed man's astonishment, the golden figure seemed to be completely unaffected as it thrust its six arms through the air, unleashing countless fist projections while continuing to charge onward.

The brocade-robed man could barely believe his own eyes, and cold sweat immediately began to flow down his forehead.

However, he then gritted his teeth before opening his mouth to expel a small azure seal, which instantly swelled to around the size of a water tank before hurtling directly toward the golden figure.

It seemed that he was trying to fight fire with fire.

Before the azure seal had even come into contact with the fist projections, it released a burst of peculiar power, and all of the fist projections were involuntarily parted down the middle.

However, the golden figure remained completely unaffected and rammed straight into the azure seal with his own body.

The brocade-robed man faltered slightly upon seeing this before an ecstatic look appeared on his face.

This azure seal was his bonded treasure, and even though its power couldn't compare with that of a Profound Heavenly Treasure, it was definitely not inferior in terms of sturdiness.

As such, there was no way the golden figure's body would be able to contend with this treasure.

Sure enough, the golden figure clashed with the azure seal amid a resounding boom akin to the sound of a giant gong being struck, and the former was sent stumbling backward over 10 steps.

Right at this moment, a giant crimson wolf's head emerged behind him amid a rank and gorey odor, then sank its sharp fangs into the golden figure's waist, plunging them several inches deep.

The golden figure shuddered before thrusting its six golden palms into the wolf's head like lightning.

Ying'er immediately chanted something upon seeing this before making a hand seal, and the wolf's head abruptly turned blurry and indistinct, allowing the golden palms to pass directly through it.

However, its fangs were still firmly embedded into the golden figure's waist, refusing to be dislodged.

The brocade-robed man was ecstatic to see this, and a hint of killing intent flashed through his eyes as his wooden ruler suddenly transformed into a purplish-black long spear.

However, right as he was about to hurl the spear toward the golden figure, a gentle breeze blew through the air behind him, and another golden figure suddenly appeared before thrusting his fists forward, both of which were riddled with layers of silver patterns.

This second golden figure was a giant golden ape with purple light emanating from its body and silver patterns running all over its skin.

This giant ape was Han Li's true body, while the other golden figure was only his Provenance Golden Body, which he was controlling with a wisp of his spiritual sense as a decoy.

Even without the Provenance Golden Body in his body, Han Li's physical body was just as powerful as before with his Hundred Meridian Refinement Mantra in being used in conjunction with his Giant Mountain Ape form.

Ying'er's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and she wanted to issue some words of caution, but it was already too late.

The brocade-robed man had sensed Han Li's emergence almost right away, and he immediately swiveled around in an alarmed manner before hurling his spear toward Han Li instead.

However, the spear was swatted aside with ease by one of Han Li's oncoming fists, while his other fist struck one of the five-colored shields around his opponent.

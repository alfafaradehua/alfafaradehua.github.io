                                    <h3>Chapter 2097: Nirvana Bead</h3><p>Another black crescent was unleashed by the giant sword, and spatial fluctuations erupted as countless black threads instantly appeared around Bai Qi before converging toward him.</p><p>At the same time, an inky-black devilish hand appeared above the Spirit Monarch projection before swooping down with devastating force.</p><p>Bai Qi clearly hadn't expected Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan to suddenly attack, and his expression changed drastically as he released a layer of protective white light around his own body while expelling a small dark green shield out of his mouth.</p><p>As soon as the shield emerged, it swelled to around 100 feet in size, and green light flashed over its surface as a giant turtle projection emerged, shielding Bai Qi behind itself.</p><p>Additionally, a loud bell chime rang out as a huge silver bell flew out of Bai Qi's body.</p><p>The ball was around 10 feet in size with an extremely bright surface that was riddled with countless silver runes.</p><p>The bell tolled, and layers of silver patterns surged forth from its surface in a frenzy.</p><p>In this dire situation, Bai Qi had revealed his true form in an attempt to withstand the oncoming attack.</p><p>However, just because Han Li was able to survive an attack from the Black Devil Dagger didn't mean that Bai Qi was capable of doing the same.</p><p>The black threads converged light lightning, instantly tearing through the silver patterns and giant turtle projection with ease.</p><p>After that, all of the black threads vanished into thin air, immediately following which countless specks of black light erupted over the surface of the silver bell.</p><p>Bai Qi didn't even get a chance to cry out before his true body was sliced into countless pieces.</p><p>As for the Spirit Monarch projection, even though it contained a wisp of a Grand Ascension Stage being's soul, it possessed no magic power whatsoever, so it was also instantly destroyed by the black devilish claw.</p><p>Han Li and the others were all completely rooted to the spot by this sudden turn of events.</p><p>The black-robed young man swept a sleeve toward the fragments of Bai Qi's body, and a burst of black light swept forth, drawing several storage bracelets into his grasp in a flash.</p><p>He quickly assessed the contents of the storage bracelets with his spiritual sense, upon which his expression darkened significantly.</p><p>"As expected, that old bastard didn't give the Realmfall Stone to any of these juniors of his."</p><p>After arriving at this conclusion, the black-robed young man turned toward Han Li's trio with a hint of killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>"Which one of you has the Realmfall Stone? If you hand it over, I can spare your life!"</p><p>Han Li and the others exchanged a bewildered glance upon hearing this.</p><p>"I'm afraid you're mistaken, Senior. Even our fellow daoists of the Spirit Race don't have what you're looking for; how could it possibly be in our possession?" Han Li sighed in a resigned manner.</p><p>Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan had already anticipated this answer, but he was still infuriated nonetheless. "In that case, there's no need for me to keep you three around any longer; you can all disappear!"</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, he abruptly raised his giant black sword before slashing it upward.</p><p>Black runes immediately appeared on the surface of the black sword, and an inky-black sword projection swept up into the air.</p><p>"Stop him! He's trying to break through the restriction to draw devilish Qi into this place!" the Long Family patriarch yelled as he immediately raised a hand, sending three small golden tridents hurtling through the air.</p><p>As soon as the tridents emerged, they transformed into three streaks of golden light, which released a burst of enormous force that weighed directly down upon the black sword projection from above.</p><p>A resounding boom rang out, and the sword projection only faltered for a split-second before slicing through the golden light, breaking the three tridents into six pieces, all of which plummeted down from the heavens.</p><p>However, during this split-second delay, a crimson bead that was enveloped in five-colored light had flown through the air before striking the sword projection with tremendous force.</p><p>The woman from the Ye Family had also summoned a disposable treasure that she had been unwilling to use before this.</p><p>The crimson bead crashed into the sword projection with a dull thump, following which a crimson fiery cloud that was around an acre in size erupted forth, staining the entire sky a bright red.</p><p>Within the fiery cloud were countless golden and silver threads, and the surrounding temperature instantly began to spike at an alarming rate; even the pond down below was beginning to bubble and churn.</p><p>It was as if the entire Spirit Trapping were about to be set alight!</p><p>"Nirvana Bead!" Han Li exclaimed in a surprised manner.</p><p>This was a vastly renowned treasure even in the context of the entire Spirit Realm, and it could only be refined through the use of a secret technique by someone with a true spirit bloodline, thereby imbuing the bead with a wisp of Nirvana Flames.</p><p>True spirit blood had to be expended to refine the treasure, and the Nirvana Flames was a type of fire that only some fire-attribute true spirit beings possessed, so it was naturally extremely fearsome.</p><p>Even though this was the first time Han Li had ever seen such a treasure, he was confident that the average late-Body Integration Stage being wouldn't be able to withstand these Nirvana Flames.</p><p>This was most likely one of the most powerful trump cards that the woman from the Ye Family had retained, but it was yet to be seen whether it would actually be effective against the sword projection unleashed by the Black Devil Dagger.</p><p>At the same time, the two extreme mountains that Han Li was holding were beginning to emit a faint buzzing sound. All of a sudden, arcs of golden lightning sprang out of his giant ape body, and they intertwined to form a massive net around him.</p><p>The black-robed young man's expression changed slightly at the sight of the Nirvana Flames, and a layer of translucent black light suddenly appeared over the surface of his giant sword as he injected more magic power into it.</p><p>A sharp screeching sound rang out from the sword projection up above, and it pierced through the crimson fiery cloud with unstoppable force before rising up toward the green light barrier.</p><p>The sword projection was slightly thinner than when it had been first released, but it had become even more fearsome following that influx of magic power.</p><p>Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted beneath the green light barrier, and Han Li abruptly appeared with golden lightning surging all over his massive ape body.</p><p>As soon as he emerged, he let loose a thunderous roar before hurling his two extreme mountains viciously toward the rising sword projection.</p><p>With his current late-Body Integration Stage cultivation base, he possessed extraordinary strength in his Giant Mountain Ape form, and the extreme mountains were sent crashing downward at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The world's origin Qi in the wake of the two mountains churned violently, and countless cracks appeared in the nearby space, as if it were about to be torn apart.</p><p>The black sword projection clashed with the pair of extreme mountains, and two resounding booms rang out in unison.</p><p>Two bursts of incredibly tremendous force surged out of the pair of extreme mountains in a frenzy, and the entire sword projection was shattered amid an anguished wail, then disintegrated into specks of black light.</p><p>Thus, the two extreme mountains were able to continue crashing down toward the black-robed young man without any further impediment.</p><p>"That's a very powerful body refinement technique; it seems to be related to the devilish arts of Elder Devil Realm as well. However, you're a fool if you think it'll work against me," the black-robed young man chuckled coldly.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, he clenched his spare hand into a fist, then unleashed two punches up into the air in succession.</p><p>Two fist projections erupted forth almost in complete unison, then struck the pair of extreme mountains with unerring accuracy.</p><p>Two resounding booms rang out, and the pair of extreme mountains were stopped cold in their tracks before suddenly flying back up toward Han Li.</p><p>Han Li was very alarmed by this, and his giant ape arms instantly expanded drastically in size before he thrust his palms down toward the two extreme mountains from above.</p><p>As soon as his hands came into contact with the pair of extreme mountains, he let loose a low roar, and his enormous body was forced back around a dozen steps. With each backtracking step he took, space beneath his feet rippled as if he were stepping onto solid ground.</p><p>A hint of shock flashed through his eyes, only now did he realize that as one of the three devilish patriarchs, Yuan Yan's powers were far superior to those of the average Grand Ascension Stage being; even his physical body was significantly more powerful than Han Li's.</p><p>Right at this moment, two streaks of light flashed through the air, and the Long Family patriarch and the woman from the Ye Family arrived beside Han Li.</p><p>They were afraid of being divided and conquered by Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan, so they immediately joined Han Li before looking down with a grim expression.</p><p>At this point, it was clear to them that Han Li was the only one who could offer some true resistance, and they could only assist him where possible.</p><p>After sending the pair of extreme mountains flying with his fists, a derisive sneer appeared on the black-robed young man's face, yet just as he was about to say something, an unexpected turn of events suddenly unfolded.</p><p>A barely visible white thread suddenly sprang forth from the fragments of the silver bell that was Bai Qi's true body, then instantly flew over to the Faux Immortal Puppet that was hovering beside Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan.</p><p>Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan faltered slightly upon seeing this before hurriedly reaching out toward the white thread like lightning, but it was already too late.</p><p>The white thread vanished into the Faux Immortal Puppet's body in a flash, and a furious look appeared on Sacred Ancestor Yuan Yan's face as he grabbed toward the puppet instead.</p><p>

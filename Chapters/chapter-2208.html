                                    <h3>Chapter 2208: First Grand Ascension Stage Battle</h3><p>Both the five-colored streaks of light and the lightning crashing down from above were instantly destroyed by the black soundwaves, and the Black Owl Monarch let loose a loud cry as he made a grabbing motion downward.</p><p>The black soundwaves immediately converged toward his hand, then transformed into a black Kirin projection that pounced forward violently.</p><p>Gusts of glacial Yin winds were swept up around the projection, causing the air to warp and blur as if it were about to be frozen solid.</p><p>Han Li's expression remained unchanged, and he merely pointed a finger upward.</p><p>A burst of silver flames flew out of his fingertip, then transformed into a giant Fire Raven that opened its beak to release a pillar of crimson light directly upward.</p><p>A huge hole was instantly punched into the Kirin projection's body by the pillar of light, and the projection disintegrated into nothingness along with the glacial winds.</p><p>The silver Fire Raven then unleashed another pillar of crimson light directly toward the Black Owl Monarch, and it traveled extraordinarily quickly, reaching the Black Owl Monarch in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, the Black Owl Monarch merely opened his mouth to devour the pillar of light, then smacked his lips as he praised, "Not bad!"</p><p>All of the cultivators down below were stunned to see this, but a smile appeared on Han Li's face as he said, "We're both Grand Ascension Stage beings, so let's do away with these little tricks; let's use our true powers to decide this battle." </p><p>"My thoughts exactly!"</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch was infuriated by Han Li's condescending attitude, and he opened his mouth to release a green jade fan that landed in his grasp. At the same time, his body swelled drastically to several thousand feet tall amid bursts of swirling black light.</p><p>The jade fan in his hand had also expanded to around 1,000 feet in length, and its surface was riddled with countless golden and silver runes. </p><p>On top of that, the fan was enshrouded within seven layers of light, creating quite a mystical sight to behold.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch's muscular arm bulged as he swept the giant fan through the air, sending a vast expanse of seven-colored light crashing down toward Han Li and the people on the plaza.</p><p>The cultivators on the plaza immediately adopted defensive measures in a horrified manner, and thus, countless treasures rose up into the air in retaliation.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on the Black Owl Monarch upon seeing this, and he pointed a finger at the jade fan, upon which a burst of black Qi shot out of his fingertip before vanishing into the fan.</p><p>As a result, the seven-colored light it had unleashed swelled even further, and the attacks from all of the opposing treasures were instantly nullified.</p><p>In the next instant, many of the weaker cultivators present threw up mouthfuls of blood essence, both from magic power backlash and due to the enormous spiritual pressure of the giant fan weighing down upon them from above.</p><p>The more powerful cultivators were able to just barely repress the effects of the backlash, but their blood and magic power were also churning violently, rendering them unable to unleash any further attacks.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch had crushed all of the cultivators on the entire plaza, and even though it was only for a short while, this was still an extraordinary feat.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch was very pleased with himself, yet just as he was about to burst into hearty laughter, his gaze fell upon Han Li, following which his expression immediately stiffened.</p><p>Han Li was standing atop his giant azure lotus with azure flames rising up over 1,000 feet from his body to keep the seven-colored light at bay with ease. He was currently appraising the Black Owl Monarch with a hint of a smile on his face, completely unaffected by his attack.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch was further incensed upon seeing this, and the seven-colored light focused most of its power on Han Li at his behest.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, a giant ball of seven-colored light took shape above Han Li, and Han Li's smile faded at the sight of the ball of light, but he then immediately harrumphed coldly, "Know your place!"</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, he made a hand seal, and a purplish-golden projection with three heads and six arms emerged behind him amid a flash of golden light.</p><p>Not only was the projection completely enshrouded in purplish-golden light, there were silver spirit patterns all over its body, and it instantly transformed into the substantial Provenance Golden Body.</p><p>As soon as the golden body appeared, it thrust all six of its shimmering golden palms upward in unison.</p><p>A resounding boom immediately rang out up above as six bursts of enormous power erupted upward, forcibly keeping the ball of seven-colored light at bay.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and he rubbed his hands together before raising them, sending a torrential barrage of incantation seals flying into the giant fan.</p><p>Even so, the giant fan was still unable to descend any further.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch was truly astonished to see this, yet before he had a chance to do anything, Han Li swept a sleeve toward the massive azure lotus flower below him, and it immediately exploded as 72 streaks of azure sword Qi rose up into the in unison.</p><p>The streaks of sword Qi then combined to form a giant azure sword projection, which came crashing down toward the Black Owl Monarch at an incredible speed.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch harrumphed coldly upon seeing this, and he raised a mountainous hand to catch the oncoming sword projection before tightening his grip, upon which the sword projection immediately exploded, unable to withstand the crushing force of his grip.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch immediately burst into raucous laughter upon seeing this, but in the next instant, the azure light that had exploded through the air shot forth as a translucent thread that revolved around his wrist in the blink of an eye. </p><p>A geyser of blood erupted over 100 feet up into the air, and the giant hand was completely detached.</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch howled with agony as he hurriedly tossed his giant fan aside before reaching for his detached hand.</p><p>However, right at this moment, Han Li suddenly vanished on the spot, then reappeared beside the detached hand amid a burst of spatial fluctuations.</p><p>As soon as he emerged, he raised a hand to lay a finger on the massive hand without any hesitation, upon which it instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>"I'm going to tear you to pieces!" The Black Owl Monarch's eyed reddened with fury upon seeing this, and he let loose a thunderous roar as five silver claws sprang out of his fingertips, each of which was several feet in length.</p><p>The claws were then slashed downward like five sharp blades, in response to which Han Li casually lashed out again as a faint smile appeared on his face.</p><p>Countless silver patterns instantly surfaced over his body alongside a purplish-golden light barrier, and as soon as the five sharp claws struck his body, they were immediately snapped like twigs bursts of piercing purplish-golden light.</p><p>"Argh!"</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch could hardly believe what he was seeing!</p><p>Yaksha beings were renowned for their powerful physical bodies, and having just unleashed a secret technique, his Grand Ascension Stage body was naturally powerful to the extreme. On top of that, his five claws had been specially refined, making them as powerful as spirit treasures, but they had been snapped by Han Li's physical body alone!</p><p>The Black Owl Monarch was immediately struck by a sense of foreboding, but it was already too late for him to withdraw his hand.</p><p>Han Li's arm extended by several feet amid an explosive boom, and he lashed out with a seemingly gentle punch to strike the opposing mountainous hand.</p><p>A burst of scintillating light erupted alongside another thunderous roar of fury, and Han Li merely chuckled as he casually flew back to several hundred feet away, then steadied himself as a mocking smile appeared on his face.</p><p>At the same time, the scintillating light faded, revealing an extremely encouraging scene to all of the cultivators on the plaza.</p><p>As it turned out, most of the Black Owl Monarch's arm had disappeared, and what remained of it was nothing more than a mangled mass of broken flesh and bones.</p><p>"You progressed to the Grand Ascension Stage while primarily using a body refinement secret technique!" the Black Owl Monarch exclaimed with incredulity as a hint of wariness appeared in his eyes for the first time.</p><p>"I guess you can say that. Seeing as you've already come here, why don't you stay for a few days in our human race before you go, Fellow Daoist Black Owl," Han Li replied with an ambiguous smile.</p><p>"Hmph, don't think that these trivial injuries will hinder me; the show has only just begun. I was only caught off guard by your attack; there's no way a rookie Grand Ascension Stage being like you could be a match for me," the Black Owl Monarch said in a vicious manner as bursts of black Qi surged out of his body to instantly inundate the entirety of his massive frame.</p><p>A string of loud cracks and pops rang out incessantly from within the black Qi, and a hint of surprise appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this.</p><p>In the next instant, the black Qi dissipated, and it was revealed that the Black Owl Monarch had fully regenerated from all of his injuries.</p><p>"So you've cultivated an immortal body; it's no wonder that you dare to fight me directly with your physical body," Han Li mused as he appraised the Black Owl Monarch.</p><p>"Hmph, I'll concede that your physical body is more powerful than mine, but how about this? Reversing Heaven and Earth!" The Black Owl Monarch's body expanded even further in size, and it swept an arm through the air, sending a burst of indescribable energy fluctuations spreading in all directions.</p><p>"You're using the power of laws!" Han Li murmured to himself as his pupils contracted slightly.</p><p>"That's right, there's no way a rookie Grand Ascension Stage being like you could have much of an understanding of the laws of heaven and earth," the Black Owl Monarch guffawed as a thin black line suddenly appeared in the air before him.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, the line blurred, and heaven and earth suddenly flipped as the sky became inky-black, while the earth abruptly became bright and clear.</p><p>

                                    <h4>Chapter 641: Heavenvoid Cauldron and the Small Bottle</h4><p dir="ltr">The silver-haired old man rejoiced upon seeing that Han Li had yet to refuse. Continuing with his earnest tone, he said, &ldquo;Be at ease, Fellow Daoist Han. Although you will take on the title as one of the sect&rsquo;s chief elders, you won&rsquo;t be tied to any trivial responsibilities and may do as you wish. Your mere existence will serve as deterrence. Each year, our sects&rsquo; disciples will offer us over a thousand spirit stones that we may use for cultivation. And if there are any spirit medicines or materials that we require in particular, we may order our disciples to find them for us, instead of spending our own time. In short, your status as an elder of our Drifting Cloud Sect will be superior to those in other sects.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Cultivator Lu slowly added, &ldquo;Senior Martial Brother speaks true. Although Brother Han has finished condensing a Nascent Soul, he must be puzzled as to how to consolidate it since this must be new to him. We don&rsquo;t mean to boast, but after spending several hundred years stuck at early Nascent Soul stage, we possess a few unique cultivation experiences. If Fellow Daoist enters our sect, we will be able to provide some guidance.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of a Nascent Soul cultivator would cause the sect&rsquo;s power to immediately rise. Although their might still wouldn&rsquo;t be comparable to the Ancient Sword Sect, they would be on par with the Hundred Possibilities Pavilion, subsequently stabilizing the Drifting Cloud Sect&rsquo;s position in the Dreamcloud Mountains.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li felt somewhat tempted by Cultivator Lu&rsquo;s conditions. As someone who had just formed a Nascent Soul, he knew what guidance from those who had condensed a Nascent Soul for hundreds of years signified. It may allow him to save anywhere from tens to a hundred years of bitter cultivation.</p><p dir="ltr">As for staying at the Drifting Cloud Sect, it wasn&rsquo;t as if he hadn&rsquo;t considered it, but he had yet to analyze the benefits and drawbacks. Since they had now taken the initiative to mention it, he had no choice to carefully decide.</p><p dir="ltr">Would he continue to act as a vagrant cultivator? Seize this opportunity to become a Drifting Cloud Sect elder? Or should he bluntly find a more suitable sect to enter?</p><p dir="ltr">After muttering to himself for a long while, Han Li raised his head and said, &ldquo;Thank you very much for your kind intentions, Fellow Daoists. However, I have just formed a Nascent Soul and my mind is on edge. For something this important, could you two give me a few days to consider it? Three days should be enough to give a reply.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">When they heard Han Li&rsquo;s words, the two couldn&rsquo;t help but glance at one another. After a short moment of thought, the old man gave an embarrassed reply, &ldquo;We are quite ashamed. It seems we were too impatient. It is only natural to require a few days to consider the matter. For now, we&rsquo;ll turn the surroundings into a forbidden area to avoid our disciples from disturbing you. We&rsquo;ll come back to pay you a visit in three day&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; Once that was said, the two leisurely chatted with Han Li before tactfully taking their leave.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li politely escorted the two out before sitting down once more in the hall. His brow was tightly knitted as if in heavy thought.</p><p dir="ltr">White light flashed from outside the hall and Silvermoon gracefully walked into the hall in her fox form.</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li glanced at the small fox and curiously asked, &ldquo;Is your magic power not enough to assume your human form?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon raised her delicate head and dejectedly said, &ldquo;That is so, Master! My magic power as an artifact spirit along with the spiritual power of the fox can only sustain the human form for a short amount of time. I won&rsquo;t be able to turn back into human form until next month.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;When you truly become a grade eight demon beast, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep a human form eternally. There is no need to be impatient.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon earnestly said, &ldquo;Fair enough. I&rsquo;ve spent countless years in the Heavenvoid Cauldron, what is a few more hundred years? Moreover, with the assistance of master&rsquo;s medicine pills, I&rsquo;ll be able to reach that height far earlier than expected!&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li nodded his head but his voice suddenly grew heavy, &ldquo;Speaking of the Heavenvoid Cauldron, I&rsquo;ve never asked about it before because my cultivation was lacking. But now that I am a Nascent Soul cultivator, tell me about it. After all, you should know how to open the cauldron given the many years you stayed inside it. Also, I am quite curious about the many other treasures in the cauldron apart from the Heavenmend Pill.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon paused for a moment and sighed, &ldquo;Of course I know how to open the cauldron. However, I fear that Master will be somewhat disappointed.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li rubbed his chin and doubtfully said, &ldquo;Oh! Do you mean that I am still unable to open the cauldron at my current cultivation?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon slowly said, &ldquo;Originally, the other ancient treasures and I were only able to escape the bindings of the Divine Spirit Treasure because the Celestial Ice Flames surrounding it were disturbed by those in the Hall with master at the time.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">A trace of suspicion flickered from his face and he astonishedly asked, &nbsp;&ldquo;What are Divine Spirit Treasures? Is the Heavenvoid Cauldron not an ancient treasure? From your tone, there seems to be a close relationship between the Celestial Ice Flames and the Heavenvoid Cauldron.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon explained with a heavy tone.&ldquo;Divine Spirit Treasures were what cultivators of the past called &lsquo;ancient treasures&rsquo;. However, only ancient treasures that possessed amazing abilities were labeled as such, the Heavenvoid Cauldron being among them. Although I don&rsquo;t know what amazing abilities the cauldron possessed, its might is far beyond that of common ancient treasures. As for the Celestial Ice flames, they are a crucial factor in opening the Heavenvoid Cauldron. No, it is more appropriate to say that they are the first step to controlling the Heavenvoid Cauldron. Master must first refine the flames before being able to do anything else.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li smiled and asked, &ldquo;Divine Spirit Treasures? They must be outstanding for even ancient cultivators to put them in high regard. Since refining the flames is only the first step, what else must I do? You may as well tell me all at once.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li wasn&rsquo;t upset by this. He clearly understood that many conditions required to use this treasure merely indicated that its power was beyond what he had expected. This matter was a pleasant surprise. So long as he has the Heavenvoid Cauldon in his hands, there will come a day where he will be able to control it. Han Li was certain of this without a doubt.</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon shook her head and truthfully replied, &ldquo;I do not know the steps that follow. I only know enough to give Master suggestions after he refines the Celestial Ice Flames.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So its like that. Then this will be somewhat troublesome. But even this is fine. I&rsquo;ll just have to refine the Celestial Ice Flames first and decide what to do later. By the way, you didn&rsquo;t mention the other treasures that the cauldron contained.&rdquo; Han Li initially revealed disappointment but he then deeply glanced at Silvermoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Fearing that Han Li would be discontent, she hastily explained, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hide it. Its just that apart from two more Heavenmend Pills, there are no other treasures; just an empty cauldron. After all, the Heavenvoid Cauldron spent countless years in Heavenvoid Hall and had a few great cultivators that were able to disturb the Celestial Ice Flames. Each time this occurred, one or two ancient treasures would seize the opportunity to escape. As such, it is natural for the cauldron to grow empty. By the time you&rsquo;d arrived, there were only the ancient treasures that you spotted.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li didn&rsquo;t reveal the slightest annoyance as if he had already anticipated this. &ldquo;Since its like that, then so be it. At my current cultivation, common ancient treasures are beneath me. It would be best to be able to make the Heavenvoid Cauldron mine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon chuckled and said, &ldquo;I am full of admiration towards Master for being able to release me! Master&rsquo;s words aren&rsquo;t wrong. According to what I know, even in times of antiquity, there were only about sixty ancient treasures that were capable of being titled as a spirit treasure. Each and every one seemed capable of vast abilities that could shake the world. In truth, I originally thought that Master&rsquo;s small bottle was a spirit treasure, but after some further thought, I felt it to be unlikely.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li was stunned and doubtfully asked, &ldquo;Oh? Could it be that my small bottle&rsquo;s abilities aren&rsquo;t enough to be an ancient treasure?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">The small fox licked its lips and solemnly replied, &ldquo;Of course not. Master&rsquo;s small bottle has the abilities to view the spirit treasures with disdain. After all, no matter how grand the abilities of the spirit treasures, they must still comply with the heavenly laws of this world. Those spirit treasures merely utilize the laws of this world to a greater extend, but that small bottle&rsquo;s ability to age medicine is a truly heaven-defying matter. I reckon that such an item can only be refined once you ascend into the spirit realm or the world above it.&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Han Li felt his breath turn cold and he passionately asked, &ldquo;You mean to say that this bottle could&rsquo;ve been a treasure refined by Immortals of a higher realm?&rdquo;</p><p dir="ltr">Silvermoon nodded, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It is certainly possible!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When Han Li heard this, he grew silent and suddenly took out the small bottle from his storage pouch. His expression stirred as he carefully examined it in his hands.</p><p dir="ltr">A long while later, Han Li carefully put the bottle away and asked, &ldquo;Silvermoon, you were listening in the next room. Do you feel that I should stay or find somewhere better?&rdquo;</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-640.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-642.html">Next</a></li>

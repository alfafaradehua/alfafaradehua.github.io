                                    <p>Chapter 1255: Suppressing Two Demons</p><p>When Feng Xi saw this, he felt a chill down his back, &lsquo;Those two axes are something I acquired from a Nascent Soul cultivator I killed. They have many uncommon abilities, but they were unable to activate and were seized by that unremarkable small cauldron without any effort.</p><p>As of current, he realized Han Li was no longer the Core Formation cultivator that fled for his life.</p><p>After his first strike failed, the wyrm king didn&rsquo;t continue his attack. Instead, he recalled the golden halberd with a wave of his hand and said, &ldquo;Fellow Daoist Feng, be careful. That small cauldron is the Heavenvoid Cauldron of human legend. It would be best for us to attack together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Heavenvoid Cauldron! Yes, let&rsquo;s do as you say. So long as we kill this person, I&rsquo;ll give the cauldron to you. All I want are the Thunderstorm Wings that was taken from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is agreed.&rdquo; The wyrm king wildly laughed and golden armor shined from his body. Dazzling golden light radiated from his body as his body ascended into the air like a blazing sun. The light was near blinding.</p><p>It was clear the demon was circulating the fullest extent of his body&rsquo;s magic power.</p><p>Then, an inconceivable event occurred.</p><p>The wyrm king let out a long shriek and a light blurred from underneath his ribs, producing another pair of gold-scaled arms.</p><p>The two arms grabbed at the air and light flashed. One of the arms held a white meter-long sword while the other was holding onto a small glistening shield. The shield was filled with coin-sized scales, appearing as if they were refined from the scales of the wyrm king himself.</p><p>The demon then pointed his only free hand at the sky and formed an incantation gesture as if making use of a secret technique.</p><p>When Han Li saw this, he narrowed his eyes and his face grew sullen. The words &lsquo;Sacred Provenance Plate&rsquo; appeared in his mind along with its connection to the Elder Devils.&nbsp;</p><p>Feng Xi tore away at the robes on his body to reveal his bare upper body. He then lowered his torso and revealed two protrusions on his back, followed by the unfolding of his wings. Each of the wings was three meters long and was bright green.</p><p>At that same time, Feng Xi&rsquo;s face turned dark grey and his hands turned into extremely sharp claws that possessed a chilling sheen.</p><p>Both of the demons were now in half transformations.</p><p>Han Li curved his mouth several times as he watched this and eventually settled with a slight smile. &ldquo;It seems you two are taking me seriously now. That is fine, but don&rsquo;t blame me for having some help too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Before the wyrm king and Feng Xi understood the meaning of Han Li&rsquo;s words, they heard wailing and shrieks from the horizon, as if something were flying towards them from all sides. At that same time, white light flashed from underneath the island, followed by a dozen white streaks ascending from the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Attack! Kill him before his help arrives!&rdquo; A fierce expression appeared on the wyrm king&rsquo;s face as he shouted.</p><p>Soon after, the wyrm king ceased his incantation gesture and opened his mouth, releasing a dense beam of golden light as he set into motion. He pounced so quickly at Han Li, he left an afterimage in his wake, still unleashing light from his mouth.</p><p>Feng Xi didn&rsquo;t dare to slow down. He unfolded his wings and wrapped himself in a gale, blurring his image as he charged forward.</p><p>When Han Li saw this, he raised his brow, but he didn&rsquo;t move. He raised his hand to reveal a green wooden ruler and spun it in his palm.</p><p>A large silver lotus bloomed in front of him and covered him completely.</p><p>And with a flip of his other hand, a ball of tri-colored light lit up, turning into a feathered fan.</p><p>Han Li took hold of it and waved it in the direction of the incoming ray of light.</p><p>A pillar of tri-colored flame rushed out and struck the golden pillar of light in front of silver lotus.</p><p>A large gust blew from the collision. Although the ray of light was condensed from the wyrm king&rsquo;s demon power, the pillar of flame stopped it and seemed to even be consuming it.</p><p>When the Golden Wyrm King saw this, his heart trembled, but he didn&rsquo;t stop in the slightest and waved one of his arms.</p><p>Golden light flickered and the wyrm scale shield was summoned forward. It turned into a dense barrier of light around him, protecting him as he brandished his other two weapons.</p><p>White swordlight and the golden spear streak filled the air with flowing radiance, raining down attacks like a storm at the tri-colored flame.</p><p>Not only were the golden spear and the white sword amazingly sharp, but they didn&rsquo;t fear the immense heat from the flames. Gold and white light seemed to weave a net, rigidly blocking the halo of light that followed from the eruption of the flame.</p><p>Han Li was astonished, but he couldn&#39;t deal with this matter as of current, as Feng Xi had circled around him using an unknown movement technique. From over a hundred meters away, Feng Xi now flew around to his side.</p><p>His two wings unfolded and he readied his claws.</p><p>The sound of tearing winds loudly sounded.</p><p>Countless feathers erupted from his wings in a barrage of arrows, and each swipe of his talons produced countless claw streaks, all of them striking at Han Li&rsquo;s silver lotus barrier.</p><p>Han Li glanced at Feng Xi&rsquo;s overbearing attacks with seeming indifference, but nevertheless, he opened his mouth and summoned three golden streaks.</p><p>Heavy rings continuously sounded out as the azure feathers and claw streaks struck the surface of the lotus, but the attacks seemed to disappear as soon as they struck while the lotus remained unharmed and continued to spin in place.</p><p>When shock appeared on Feng Xi&rsquo;s face from seeing his attacks nullified, three inch-long golden swords oddly warped in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>The demon unconsciously waved his wings in a start, and his body blurred.</p><p>The sword Qi flashed and the small swords pierced holes in him, but all they struck was an afterimage.</p><p>In the following moment, Feng Xi appeared over seventy meters away. His face was pale as if the maneuver cost him much magic power.</p><p>Han Li frowned. He hadn&rsquo;t anticipated that the demon would have such mastery over wind evasion techniques. If he wished to kill the demon, he would spend some effort.</p><p>Having thought this, he commanded the small swords to extend to a foot in length, turn around, and closely pursue Feng Xi.</p><p>Feng Xi&rsquo;s expression turned cold.</p><p>Suddenly, a pair of large azure claws appeared in midair and swiped at the swords with lightning speed. In a moment, all of them were captured.</p><p>A wicked expression appeared from the demon&rsquo;s face and he used a secret technique to clamp down with all his might, intending to crush them.</p><p>But when the claws lit up with azure light, he saw that the swords didn&rsquo;t have the slightest trace of damage.</p><p>Feng Xi&rsquo;s heart dropped.</p><p>Before he could think of anything else, he heard several drones.</p><p>The golden flying swords took advantage of his moment of carelessness to break free from their capture, instead winding around the huge claws that captured them and easily cutting them to pieces.</p><p>The destroyed claws scattered with the wind.</p><p>The flying swords then changed direction, swiftly continuing their pursuit of Feng Xi.</p><p>This time, Feng Xi felt an even greater shock.</p><p>He quickly opened his mouth and an azure jade bowl flew out. It flipped through the air, suddenly producing an azure barrier to sweep away the flying swords.</p><p>As the two sides clashed, several crisp cracks sounded. Under the bright golden glow of the flying swords, the azure barrier was pierced through with ease.</p><p>Feng Xi&rsquo;s expression greatly changed. He no longer dared to meet the flying swords head-on, and he flapped his wings flying off to the size in an azure streak. The flying swords changed direction, silently continuing their close pursuit at a speed no slower than Feng Xi&rsquo;s.</p><p>At that moment, the demon began to curse in his mind.</p><p>As he was forced to twist through the skies, he took a glance at the Golden Wyrm King.</p><p>As a result, his heart sank even further.</p><p>The Golden Wyrm King blocked the tri-colored flames and had arrived next to Han Li. He struck at the silver lotus with ferocity, each attack seeming to scatter the lotus slightly.</p><p>Within the lotus, Han Li simply waved the emerald ruler in his hand a few times and restored all of the damage with a few flashes of seven-colored Buddhist light.</p><p>The Golden Wyrm King was unable to deal with him.</p><p>Feng Xi&rsquo;s eyes looked around him and he began to ponder whether he should escape. It was clear that Han Li&rsquo;s current abilities far exceeded what he had imagined. And the ferocious flying swords were more than enough to deal with two of him.</p><p>But then, the demon came to a sudden stop and remained in place, revealing Feng Xi&rsquo;s half-demon form.</p><p>At some unknown time, a dozen meter-long snow-white centipedes had surrounded him. They had four wings and sparkling crystalline bodies.</p><p>&ldquo;The Six-winged Frost Centipedes!&rdquo; When Feng Xi recognized them, he cried out in alarm and wore an unsightly expression.</p><p>The Golden Wyrm King&rsquo;s fierce assault on the lotus also came to a sudden stop, and he tore through the air in a golden streak, hoping to get away.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s indifferent voice sounded from within the lotus, &ldquo;It is already too late to think of running away.</p><p>As soon as those words were said, ten red threads shot out from the lotus with extreme speed. They flickered several times and tightly wound around the demon. Following that, light flashed from them, turning into several dense ropes of flame. They continued to roil around him and drown him in them.</p><p>At that same moment, a grey demon wind blew through the sky, carrying give wheel-sized ghost heads. They all appeared fierce and wailed without end. They entered the sea of flames without any regard for it.</p><p>Within the flames, the Golden Wyrm King let out a shout of terror. His cold scream contained an immense fear.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1254.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1256.html">Next</a></li>

                                    <h3>Chapter 2289: Battle Against the Asura Spiders (3)</h3><p>Han Li naturally couldn't continue to dwell on the subject of the Moulan Sacred Beast, and he swept a sleeve through the air to release a ball of silver flames, which transformed into a silver Fire Raven in a flash.</p><p>As soon as the Fire Raven emerged, it swelled drastically to a stature that wasn't inferior to the purple phoenix, then flapped its wings and swooped directly toward the fiery purple cloud.</p><p>Even before the two massive birds had clashed, the clouds of fire around them crashed into one another, immediately following which the two birds engaged one another in a ferocious battle.</p><p>A series of sharp avian cries rang out alongside resounding explosions, and the entire sky was illuminated by the scorching purple and silver flames.</p><p>Meanwhile, thousands of balls of golden flames were crashing down toward Han Li from above.</p><p>Han Li's expression remained calm as he made a hand seal, and 72 small azure swords flew out of various parts of his body, transforming into around a dozen streaks of identical sword Qi.</p><p>Han Li then swept a sleeve upward before uttering the word "break", and the streaks of azure sword Qi immediately erupted upward, rapidly tearing through one golden fireball after another.</p><p>The black-robed man's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this, and he made a strange hand seal, upon which the thousands of mirror projections behind him began to flash with scintillating golden light.</p><p>Specks of spiritual light flashed erratically above Han Li, and all of the fragments of the golden fireballs came crashing down from above as countless streaks of golden light.</p><p>However, Han Li wasn't alarmed by this in the slightest, and a cold smile appeared on his face as he pointed a finger toward the streaks of azure sword Qi, all of which instantly vanished into thin air.</p><p>In the next instant, piercing azure light flashed above Han Li, and the streaks of azure sword Qi reappeared before converging to form a massive azure lotus flower around an acre in size.</p><p>The lotus flower rotated on the spot, and countless sword projections were released to form an impenetrable barrier.</p><p>The storm of golden light clashed with the sword projections, and the vast majority of the streaks of golden light were kept at bay, with only the rare exceptions managing to pass through, but all of those were instantly nullified upon plunging into the azure sword lotus.</p><p>Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted before Han Li, and three long silver arrows emerged before hurtling toward his face like lightning.</p><p>Han Li remained completely expressionless as he raised an arm, and one of his fingers took on a purplish-golden hue before he pointed it forward several times in succession.</p><p>Three resounding booms rang out as his finger strikes struck the tips of the three arrows with unerring accuracy, and they were sent flying back even faster than they had come before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>In the next instant, three dull thumps rang out, and three of the silver-armored warriors were felled with puncture wounds on their heads before disintegrating into specks of silver light.</p><p>The black-robed man's expression changed drastically upon seeing this, and he immediately chanted something while pointing a finger toward the silver scroll several times in succession, releasing a series of incantation seals into the scroll.</p><p>The silver scroll flashed erratically as a string of runes appeared on its surface, and the remaining silver-armored warriors all swelled to around twice their original size.</p><p>Despite this, they had somehow become extremely fast as well, and after just a few flashes, they reached Han Li in the blink of an eye before charging toward him with their weapons brandished.</p><p>A hint of disdain appeared on Han Li's face, and he harrumphed coldly before sweeping a hand through the air to conjure up a grey light barrier.</p><p>All of the oncoming attacks instantly vanished into the grey light barrier like sandcastles in the rising tide, completely nullified before they could do anything.</p><p>Right at this moment, all of the silver-armored warriors blurred, and they instantly reached Han Li as if by instantaneous teleportation before swinging their weapons toward him.</p><p>Even before their weapons had reached him, they were releasing streaks of glacial light that were threatening to tear the grey light barrier apart.</p><p>A cold light flashed through Han Li's eyes, and the grey light barrier suddenly took on a substantial form to repel the oncoming streaks of glacial light, immediately following which the grey light barrier transformed into a massive wave that was over 100 feet tall in retaliation.</p><p>The silver-armored warriors reacted very quickly, immediately rushing back in retreat, but the giant grey wave suddenly released countless light threads, which pierced through the bodies of the armored warriors like lightning before binding them tightly.</p><p>All of the armored warriors were then inundated by the grey wave, and they lost all power to resist.</p><p>A furious look appeared in the black-robed man's eyes upon seeing this, and he opened his mouth to expel a burst of magic power into the scroll, causing it to rapidly revolve on the spot.</p><p>At the same time, the trapped silver-armored warriors began to release astonishing auras alongside bursts of bright silver light.</p><p>This eruption of power seemed to be threatening to tear the entire grey wave apart, and a hint of surprise flashed through Han Li's eyes as he extended a palm forward, pressing it toward the grey wave from afar.</p><p>A dull thump rang out, and the silver light being released by the armored warriors was crushed into specks of silver light by a burst of enormous invisible force.</p><p>After that, Han Li glanced upward to discover that the Spirit Engulfing Fire Raven was still locked in battle against the purple peacock.</p><p>Neither of them possessed substantial bodies, they both possessed fire-attribute powers, so it seemed that their battle wouldn't reach a conclusion anytime soon.</p><p>Han Li's eyes narrowed slightly as he withdrew his gaze, and he said, "Let's skip all of this child's play. Seeing as you're unwilling to display your true power, I'll just have to force you to do so."</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, he made a hand seal, and the Provenance True Devil Projection emerged behind him amid a flash of golden light.</p><p>The projection opened its six eyes, then thrust its six arms through the air in unison, summoning six golden balls of light, each of which had a diameter of around 10 feet.</p><p>The six balls of light were sent hurtling directly toward the black-robed man, who gave a cold harrumph as he immediately pointed a finger forward.</p><p>Golden light flashed on the surfaces of all of the mirror projections behind him, and a thin golden thread erupted out of each mirror, forming a massive golden net.</p><p>The black-robed man then made a hand seal, and the giant net surged toward the six balls of golden light, looking as if it were trying to sweep up all of the balls of light at once.</p><p>However, in the instant that the net and the balls of light came into contact with one another, Han Li pointed a finger forward from afar, and the six balls of golden light instantly fused as one to form a shimmering golden vortex.</p><p>The vortex began to revolve on the spot, releasing countless five-colored runes, as well as a burst of tremendous suction force.</p><p>The giant golden net was also quite profound, but it was completely unable to withstand this suction force, and it was drawn into the vortex before being shredded into pieces.</p><p>The black-robed man was quite alarmed to see this, and he hurriedly patted a jade pendant that was hanging from his waist.</p><p>The jade pendant released a white wyrm at his behest, which pounced directly toward the vortex, only to be drawn in and pulverized as well.</p><p>At the same time, the jade pendant on the black-robed man's waist disintegrated into powder, and his expression changed drastically upon seeing this.</p><p>However, after rushing back in retreat, he returned to his normal calm expression before making a hand seal, and lights of five different colors suddenly erupted out of his back.</p><p>The five-colored light surged through the air, eradicating the golden vortex in a flash.</p><p>"Five-colored Divine Light! You're a Five Light being from the Flying Spirit Race!" Han Li exclaimed.</p><p>The black-robed man was rather surprised to hear this, but a sinister smile quickly appeared on his face. "Haha, you have a sharp eye, Fellow Daoist. In that case, I won't disguise my powers any longer; let me show you the true might of Five-colored Divine Light!"</p><p>A resounding boom rang out alongside an eruption of five-colored light, and a Five-colored Peacock that was several tens of feet in size emerged.</p><p>It cast a cold gaze toward Han Li, and just that alone was enough to make him feel as if his entire body had been completely frozen.</p><p>

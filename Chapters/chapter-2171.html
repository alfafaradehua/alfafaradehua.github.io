                                    <h3>Chapter 2171: Battle of the Wood Tribe (10)</h3><p>"As expected, you're no ordinary Body Integration cultivator; it's quite remarkable that you were able to teleport both of us here with formations that you created on the spot. However, do you intend to take on both of us on your own?" the elderly man asked as he appraised the giant projection behind Han Li with a cautious expression.</p><p>"The two of you are just a pair of clones, so why can't I take on both of you?" Han Li chuckled in a nonchalant manner.</p><p>"Hmph, you're going to pay the ultimate price for your arrogance!" The elderly man flared up with rage upon hearing this, and he immediately made a hand seal, upon which a burst of crimson light erupted into the heavens behind him, then formed a crimson insect projection that was over 100 feet in length.</p><p>The projection was of a bright red color and extreme rotund, resembling a giant silkworm. However, its cavernous mouth was filled with sharp fangs, presenting a terrifying sight to behold.</p><p>As soon as the insect projection appeared, it opened its mouth to expel a burst of crimson light, which split up into countless crimson threads that swept directly toward Han Li.</p><p>The smile on Han Li's face faded, and the projection behind him raised its six arms in unison at his behest.</p><p>Countless golden fist projections instantly appeared in front of him, then transformed into balls of golden light to oppose the crimson threads.</p><p>A string of resounding booms rang out in rapid succession, and the golden fist projections exploded as soon as they came into contact with the crimson threads, but the threads were all kept at bay as a result.</p><p>The elderly man harrumphed coldly upon seeing this, and he quickly made a hand seal before pointing a finger at the crimson threads.</p><p>All of a sudden, the threads began to sway and twist as if they had come alive, then vanished into thin air in a flash.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted in front of Han Li, and countless crimson threads emerged before raining down upon him in a torrential downpour.</p><p>Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and he immediately flew back by several tens of feet. At the same time, the azure sword lotuses beneath his feet swelled drastically to form several layers of azure light barriers before him.</p><p>As soon as the crimson threads flew into the azure sword barriers, they were instantly shredded.</p><p>Despite the sheer number of crimson threads, not even a single one of them was able to pierce through the light barriers, and they all disintegrated into clouds of blood mist.</p><p>Strangely enough, not only was the elderly man not disappointed to see this, a peculiar smile appeared on his face.</p><p>Right at this moment, Han Li suddenly cast his gaze toward the winged woman as if he had detected something.</p><p>A burst of blue light flashed through his eyes, and his expression darkened slightly as he quickly released his enormous spiritual sense all around himself. Immediately thereafter, one of his arms expanded drastically in size amid a string of loud cracks and pops, following which he threw a punch behind himself like lightning.</p><p>His fist instantly turned a shimmering golden color, and a burst of loud thunderclaps accompanied his punch.</p><p>At the same time, a burst of barely detectable spatial fluctuations erupted before his fist, following which a semi-transparent winged figure emerged in a wraith-like manner.</p><p>The golden fist hurtled directly toward the winged figure's head in a merciless manner, and it looked as if this were a choreographed sequence where the winged figure had set itself up to be punched.</p><p>A hint of surprise appeared on the winged figure's pale face upon seeing this, but it merely twisted around and took on a blurry quality.</p><p>The golden fist passed right through the winged figure's head, but it was as if the fist had struck nothing but thin air.</p><p>Only then did the blurry humanoid figure disintegrate into nothingness.</p><p>Han Li immediately turned around before casting his gaze toward a nearby patch of space with his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>Spatial fluctuations erupted from that patch of space, and the winged figure re-emerged before meeting Han Li's gaze with a cold one of her own.</p><p>The winged figure was none other than the winged devilish woman, but there was a completely identical figure standing right next to the elderly man at this moment.</p><p>"This is the first time I've seen a Body Integration Stage being with such exceptional illusionary and concealment abilities. If it weren't for my spirit eyes and spiritual sense, I would've been fooled into thinking that you hadn't done anything," Han Li said in a calm voice as he suddenly pointed a finger toward the winged woman beside the elderly man.</p><p>A bolt of golden lightning shot forth from his fingertip and struck the winged woman's body in a flash, upon which she instantly disintegrated into specks of white light, revealing the woman to have been nothing more than an illusion.</p><p>Both the elderly man and the true winged woman's expressions changed slightly upon seeing this, and the latter said in a cold voice, "You may have survived this attack, but what about the next one?"</p><p>Han Li faltered slightly upon hearing this before chuckling in response, "Oh? Are you planning to use the same attack against me again? Do you think it'll still work?"</p><p>"I do indeed plan to use the same attack again."</p><p>A hint of killing intent appeared in the woman's eyes as she abruptly flapped her wings, and her body vanished yet again.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted on the other side of Han Li, and she re-emerged before reaching toward him with a pair of hands that had transformed into sharp black claws.</p><p>Han Li immediately swept a sleeve through the air upon seeing this to release a streak of azure sword Qi to slice the winged woman's body in half, but it merely vanished, revealing itself to be nothing more than another projection. </p><p>Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted on the other side, and the winged woman appeared again in a wraith-like manner before unleashing countless claw projections toward Han Li.</p><p>In response, Han Li turned his head in an expressionless manner before opening his mouth to release a bolt of golden lightning that struck the winged woman, but it merely pierced through her body, revealing it to be yet another projection.</p><p>All of a sudden, the winged woman emerged above Han Li's head, then flapped her wings to send countless streaks of black light raining down from above...</p><p>Thus, with her incredible movement techniques, the winged woman was able to appear over and over again all around Han Li and unleash all types of attacks against him while her own body remained completely unharmed.</p><p>"Interesting! You teleport away as soon as you complete an attack and only leave behind a projection to fool the enemy. This is a very intriguing tactic, but I'm afraid it's not going to be effective against me," Han Li mused in an intrigued voice as blue light flashed within his eyes. All of a sudden, the Provenance True Devil Projection behind him raised its six arms in unison, and a giant golden sword appeared in each of its hands before being slashed through the air to oppose all of the oncoming attacks.</p><p>The winged woman merely ignored this and continued to phase in and out of existence around Han Li. On top of that, she was growing faster and faster, and her attacks were also becoming more and more ferocious; it was as if Han Li were being attacked by multiple people at once.</p><p>However, Han Li remained as calm as ever, and after negotiating several waves of attacks, a cold smile appeared on his face as he flipped a hand over to summon a small black mountain amid a flash of black light.</p><p>However, before he had a chance to unleash the extreme mountain, his expression suddenly changed slightly as countless arcs of golden lightning erupted from his body to form a golden lightning robe.</p><p>Almost at the exact same moment, the faint blood mist wafting through the air around him formed countless crimson threads once again before hurtling directly toward Han Li.</p><p>If he hadn't detected what was happening in advance, he really would've fallen prey to this sneak attack.</p><p>As things currently were, he merely injected more magic power into his lightning robe, which swelled drastically in size to meet the oncoming crimson threads.</p><p>The golden lightning robe flashed erratically, and the crimson threads all exploded upon coming into contact with it.</p><p>Clouds of blood mist permeated through the air once again, and the mist quickly became extremely viscous with countless crimson runes flashing within it.</p><p>The elderly man was elated to see this, and he hurriedly yelled, "Fairy Ling, hurry and use that ability!"</p><p>"Hmph, I would've done so even if you hadn't said anything," the winged woman replied in a cold voice as seven identical winged women suddenly appeared in the air around the blood mist.</p><p>As soon as these seven devilish women appeared, they rubbed their hands together in unison to produce a reddish-black devilish flag each before tossing them into the air above the blood mist.</p><p>The seven flags were only around 10 feet in length, but there was a bright red devilish formation engraved onto the surface of each flag, and they instantly transformed into seven reddish-black balls of light that began to rapidly revolve through the air.</p><p>Right at this moment, the seven devilish women began to chant an incantation while rapidly flicking incantation seals toward the devilish flags.</p><p>In the next instant, seven dull thumps rang out, and the flags abruptly vanished, replaced by seven reddish-black light formations that appeared above the blood mist.</p><p>At the center of each formation was a ball of crimson devilish flames.</p><p>

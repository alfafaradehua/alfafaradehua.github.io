                                    <p><strong>Chapter 444: Black Robes</strong></p><p>Han Li pointed at the huge sword that was struggling to break free of the abomination&rsquo;s grasp.It suddenly grew still and started to sparkle with green light.</p><p>When the middle-head that was spouting out black Qi saw this, it was stunned. Before it could even react, the flat of huge sword released several tens of arcs of faint gold lightning.</p><p>The arcs of lightning were incredibly fast. In an instant, the lightning traveled up from its furry claws onto its huge body, creating a net of golden light around the abomination&rsquo;s body.</p><p>The abomination&rsquo;s three heads simultaneously expressed shock. But before it could even move, Han Li uttered the word, &ldquo;Suffer.&rdquo; The net of lightning covering it ruptured.</p><p>A scorching, blinding white light thoroughly submerged the abomination, leaving it incapable of being seen.</p><p>In that instant, Fairy Violet Spirit and the black-robed man couldn&rsquo;t help but look over in surprise. As for their opponents, the Weiwu Ghosts and the two Nightfiends, they appeared to be at a loss for a moment before suddenly fleeing away.</p><p>The two were alarmed at the scene, but after some hesitation, they merely watched them as they fled.</p><p>However, the Weeping Soul Beast took this opportunity to forcefully snort and absorb one of the fleeing spirits into its nose.</p><p>As for the blinding white light, it persisted for some time before fading away. The tiger abomination was standing motionlessly in place, and its three heads appeared frightened. However, their expressions were completely still. When a gust of cold wind flew past it, its huge body scattered the sky with grey ash before disappeared without a trace.</p><p>All that remained was the huge sword and a fist-sized tricolored pearl floating in midair. The colors black, green and grey were interweaved in the sparkling pearl.</p><p>Han Li let out a long sigh and waved his hand. With a dim cry, the huge azure sword dispersed into eight blades and flew back to Han Li. However, four of those blades had faded away in mid-flight. The other four blades obediently returned into Han Li&rsquo;s body and sunk into dormancy.</p><p>The previous arcs of lightning cleanly exhausted the swords&rsquo; entire accumulation of its Divine Devilbane Lightning. They urgently required long term nurturing.</p><p>Han Li glanced at the strange pearl. With several blurs, his body appeared in front of the pearl. After intensely staring for it, he started muttering to himself.</p><p>After a short moment, a malicious expression flashed from his face. With a flip of his hand, an azure flying sword appeared in his hand. Han Li fiercely chopped down at the pearl with a flash of radiance.</p><p>Pang. The pearl was chopped into two, releasing three streaks of black Qi flying away as if they were fearfully escaping. However, Han Li flicked the finger of his other hand and shot out three egg-sized fireballs towards them.</p><p>Puff. Puff. Puff. The three strands of black Qi faintly released miserable wails upon being struck with the fireballs before they were dissolved by the flames.</p><p>These demon ghosts was extremely devious. They hid away within the magic treasure and lured him into grabbing it. Had he fallen for it, he&rsquo;d be in an inescapable confrontation for the control of his body.</p><p>However, this was something he had earlier anticipated when the body of the tiger abomination was exterminated by the Divine Devilbane Lightning.</p><p>After all, with the Gold Lightning Bamboo&rsquo;s grand reputation along with legends of its &ldquo;Devilbane&rdquo; characteristics, it would be truly heaven-defying if a full discharge of the four swords were unable to extinguish a demon ghost.</p><p>It was because he had this trump card that he so calmly and confidently entered the ghost mist. Despite having felt incredibly baffled when faced against the fused ghost demons, he was able to keep calm particularly because of this.</p><p>Naturally, he had originally refrained from using the Divine Devilbane Lightning since the black-robed man and Fairy Violet Spirit were nearby. However, he hadn&rsquo;t expected the fused body of the tiger abomination to be extraordinarily ferocious. When it had foolishly used its claws to grab hold of his Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords, he naturally couldn&rsquo;t let go of such a great opportunity to use his Divine Devilbane Lightning.</p><p>With that, he erased a monster that was no weaker than a late Core Formation cultivator from this world.</p><p>Han Li lowered his head to look at the split pearl and lightly shook his head. He then turned around and walked towards Fairy Violet Spirit.</p><p>When the black-robed man saw this, his face was full of shock. Although he wasn&rsquo;t able to pay close attention to Han Li&rsquo;s battle, he had caught sight of the ghost demon&rsquo;s soul possession, transformation, and combined body. It had left him so aghast that he had immediately decided to flee once Han Li appeared entirely unable to be its match. The three headed demon tiger had appeared frighteningly powerful.</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t expect that the such a monster so easily eliminated with just a burst of dazzling white light. He found it truly hard to believe. Could it be that he possessed a Heaven-Earth Inversive Antiquity from legend? He couldn&rsquo;t think of any other method that an early Core Formation cultivator like Han Li could use to exterminate the dreadful three-headed monster.</p><p>But if this were the case, he could entice Han Li and obtain a great supporter to accompany him through the Heavenvoid Hall. After all, he believed that only Nascent Soul eccentrics were capable of extinguishing such a powerful demon without the slightest injury.</p><p>With that thought, the black-robed man&rsquo;s astonished expression gradually disappeared to be replaced with a complicated expression as he looked at Han Li.</p><p>As for Fairy Violet Spirit, although she was greatly amazed by these events, she had already guessed that Han Li was an unordinary Core Formation cultivator. She quickly calmed down and looked at Han Li with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Senior Han&rsquo;s abilities are truly remarkable. He was able to effortlessly exterminate such a dreadful ghost demon. It seems I was truly fortunate to have teleported together with Senior!&rdquo; Fairy Violet Spirit gracefully said.</p><p>When Han Li heard this, he insipidly denied her, &ldquo;Effortlessly? That wasn&rsquo;t effortless in the slightest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Senior is truly modest!&rdquo; Fairy Violet Spirit&rsquo;s eyes were glowing with humor. It was obvious that she believed that Han Li wasn&rsquo;t being completely honest.</p><p>&ldquo;What did Fellow Daoist use to produce that white light? It was immensely powerful.&rdquo; The black-robed man spoke for the first time, but his voice was muffled and hoarse, sounding quite unnatural.</p><p>This unpleasant voice caused Han Li&rsquo;s eyes to flicker with a strange expression. He looked at the black-robed man with a smile.</p><p>After Han Li&rsquo;s smile faded away, he indifferently said, &ldquo;So Fellow Daoist is a female cultivator! There is no need to speak with a fake voice. Fairy Violet Spirit and have already seen through it.&rdquo;</p><p>Fairy Violet Spirit gave a charming smile upon hearing this.</p><p>The black-robed woman was initially startled, but her eyes soon revealed humiliation and anger.</p><p>A long while later, she spoke with a delicate, soft voice, &ldquo;Since you Fellow Daoists have already seen through it, I will no longer hide this. It merely made matters convenient.&rdquo;</p><p>With that said, the black-robed woman hesitated for a moment before removing the hood of her black robe, revealing an astonishingly gorgeous face.</p><p>Not only did this woman have incredibly fair and soft skin, but she had long, silky hair that was draped over her shoulder. She wore a dazzling garland on her head that added a mysterious charm, causing her to appear elegant and unyielding.</p><p>Despite being also a woman, Fairy Violet Spirit appeared breathless at the sight of the black-robed woman&rsquo;s beauty. But something soon came to mind and she stealthily took a glance at Han Li.</p><p>What she saw left her feeling somewhat uneasy.</p><p>Han Li had been looking at the black-robed woman in a daze. His eyes revealed a strange, unclear expression.</p><p>A blush appeared on the black-robed woman&rsquo;s flawless face. With both pride and gloom in her head, she coldly said, &ldquo;Has Fellow Daoist had enough to look at, or is there something something wrong with my face?&rdquo; With that said, the black-robed woman&rsquo;s expression sunk.</p><p>Han Li didn&rsquo;t grow angry at the rebuke, but neither did he withdraw his gaze. Instead, he let out a long breath and examined the woman with a mysterious smile. He appeared rather interested.</p><p>Not only did she raise her eyebrows this time, but her face also grew cold. Even Fairy Violet Spirit felt apprehensive, doubting whether or not Han Li was acting out of wicked thoughts.</p><p>But after some further thoughts, her uneasiness seemed had disappeared.</p><p>Due to predetermined innate aptitudes, there were far fewer female Core Formation cultivators in the cultivation world in comparison to male cultivators. Thus, a large majority of high grade Dao companion pairs normally consisted of a man with Core Formation cultivation and a woman at Foundation Establishment. As such, the effectiveness of pair cultivation was not ideal for the male cultivator. As for the small number for female Core Formation cultivators, they attracted many suitors that believed themselves to be worthy of them.</p><p>It made sense for a female cultivator possessing such beauty and deep cultivation as the black-robed woman to cause Han Li to feel tempted.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-443.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-445.html">Next</a></li>

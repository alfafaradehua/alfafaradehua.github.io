                                    <h3>Chapter 2288: Battle Against the Asura Spiders (2)</h3><p>The green-robed woman became even more infuriated upon seeing this, and she rubbed her hands together before raising them in unison.</p><p>Countless balls of light of different colors instantly appeared before her, and all of them surged toward Xue Ran and Hei Lin as if they had minds of their own.</p><p>Thus, a battle ensued between the three of them.</p><p>The four mature Asura Spiders on the city wall exchanged a glance upon seeing this, and after a brief discussion through voice transmission, all of them suddenly sat down with their legs crossed, then began to chant something with their eyes tightly shut. </p><p>The tops of their heads opened up, and a ball of green light that was around the size of a washbasin emerged, all of which converged to form a massive spider.</p><p>The spider was even larger than the one summoned by the green-robed woman, but its body was quite blurry, and it seemed that it was only a projection.</p><p>As soon as the giant spider projection emerged, it immediately pounced toward Xue Ran and Hei Lin.</p><p>The four mature Asura Spiders were finally stepping in to assist the green-robed woman.</p><p>Mo Jianli's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this, and he didn't appear to have done anything, but his body blurred as he abruptly vanished on the spot.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted in front of the spider projection, and a streak of glacial sword Qi came hurtling directly toward it.</p><p>The spider projection immediately opened its cavernous mouth to release a huge net to keep the sword Qi at bay, but at the same time, it was also forced to stop in mid-air.</p><p>Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted once again, and Mo Jianli emerged with a short sword in his hand.</p><p>He took a glance at the spider projection, then immediately tossed the sword up into the air.</p><p>Layers of sword projections instantly appeared, transforming into a sword mountain that came crashing down from above.</p><p>In response, the four mature Asura Spiders switched to different hand seals, and the spider projection pounced directly toward Mo Jianli through the sword mountain as if it didn't even exist.</p><p>Mo Jianli's heart jolted slightly upon seeing this, and he immediately sent a brick-shaped treasure flying through the air.</p><p>At the same time, he raised an arm before pointing a finger forward, and the brick began to release scintillating blue light, forming a taichi diagram that hurtled directly through the air.</p><p>Simultaneously, a speck of black light flashed on his outstretched fingertip, and the space up ahead suddenly collapsed as if it were being crushed by some type of invisible force.</p><p>The giant spider projection swiped its two front limbs through the air, unleashing a series of claw projections that instantly sliced the taichi diagram into pieces.</p><p>However, in the next instant, its enormous body crashed into the burst of invisible force, and as a result, it became very slow and sluggish.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Mo Jianli's face, and he uttered the word, "explode"!</p><p>The fragments of the taichi diagram immediately began to flash erratically, then exploded into specks of blue light, sending devastating glacial power surging through the air.</p><p>The spider projection shuddered slightly, and layers of frost quickly materialized over its body. In the blink of an eye, it had been sealed in a massive block of blue ice.</p><p>Mo Jianli was ecstatic to see this, and he withdrew his outstretched finger before making a grabbing motion, summoning an inky-black talisman that he hurled toward the sealed spider projection without any hesitation.</p><p>As soon as the black talisman was released, it transformed into a black beast projection with the head of a dragon and the body of a phoenix, then pounced downward in a ferocious manner.</p><p>The projection was giving off a horrifying aura that was far too powerful for the average Grand Ascension Stage being to withstand, and the four mature Asura Spiders' expressions changed drastically upon seeing this.</p><p>All of them opened their eyes in unison, and at the same time, the beastly projection vanished into the block of ice in a flash.</p><p>However, right at this moment, the spider projection exploded into specks of green light, all of which appeared outside the block of ice.</p><p>As a result, the black beastly projection completely missed its target, and after passing through the chunk of ice, its body gradually faded into nothingness.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, the specks of green light converged into four larger balls of light again, all of which sped back toward the city wall before quickly disappearing into the bodies of the four mature Asura Spiders.</p><p>In the next instant, the four mature Asura Spiders rose up as four streaks of light and flew directly toward Mo Jianli.</p><p>Mo Jianli was rather disappointed that his meticulously planned sequence of attacks had failed to achieve the intended effect, and his expression darkened slightly at the sight of the oncoming mature Asura Spiders. </p><p>All of a sudden, he flew toward the oncoming opponents as a streak of white light, and spatial fluctuations erupted behind him, upon which the white flying tiger and crimson fiery phoenix also emerged.</p><p>The trio quickly clashed with the four mature Asura Spiders, and another fierce battle commenced.</p><p>Even with those two powerful spirit beasts to assist him, Mo Jianli was still far inferior in power to four mature Asura Spiders.</p><p>However, whenever the opponents' attacks became too much to handle, Mo Jianli would toss out a few mysterious talismans, or unleash some type of almighty attack, or manifest a few strange beastly projections.</p><p>As a result, he was just barely able to hold his own against the four mature Asura Spiders.</p><p>All of a sudden, a hint of killing intent flashed through the black-robed man's eyes, and he surreptitiously summoned a golden coin in his hand, which was concealed up his sleeve.</p><p>However, just as he was about to unleash the coin's power, a calm voice rang out beside his ears.</p><p>"Your opponent is me; I'd advise you not to get distracted."</p><p>As soon as the voice trailed off, a burst of formidable spiritual pressure came crashing down from above, and even with the black-robed man's immense powers, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He immediately vanished from the city wall, and in the next instant, he reappeared over 100,000 feet above the city amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, then appraised Han Li with a grim expression.</p><p>Han Li was standing over 1,000 feet away with his hands clasped behind his back, and he was also appraising the black-robed man, but his expression was as calm as ever.</p><p>"It looks like you've already planned out these match-ups in advance. Does that mean you think you'll be able to defeat me?" the black-robed man asked.</p><p>"I'm afraid you're mistaken; after everyone else had chosen, you were the only opponent left. As for whether I'll be able to defeat you, I'll just have to try and see," Han Li replied with a calm smile.</p><p>"Hmph, it seems that you're very confident. In that case, let's see who's going to come out on top," the black-robed man said in a cold voice, then flipped a hand over to produce an antiquated azure lamp, which he immediately flicked a finger toward.</p><p>A purple flame was instantly ignited within the lamp, following which the black-robed man uttered the word "rise".</p><p>An indescribable primordial aura began to emanate from the flame, and all of a sudden, eight more identical lamps emerged, all of which hovered in the air around him.</p><p>The black-robed man then made a rapid string of hand seals, casting nine incantation seals of different colors onto the lamps.</p><p>Bright purple light radiated forth, and the flames within the nine lamps drifted out before converging to form a head-sized ball of purple flames.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, a clear cry rang out, and a purple bird that was around a foot in size emerged within the flames.</p><p>The bird had a very light and agile body with purple feathers, a long canopy, and a pair of fiery red ruby-like eyes; it was a beautiful purple peacock.</p><p>As soon as the peacock appeared, it let loose a clear cry, and it swelled drastically to around 300 to 400 feet in length amid a flash of purple light.</p><p>All of its feathers were then ignited into scorching purple flames, and it flapped its wings to release a purple fiery cloud that was around an acre in size.</p><p>A peculiar look had already appeared on Han Li's face at the sight of the azure lamps, and once the purple peacock was summoned, he was completely rooted to the spot.</p><p>"That's a Moulan Sacred Bird!" Han Li murmured to himself with a peculiar expression.</p><p>The summoning method, appearance, and aura of this purple phoenix were extremely similar to that of the Moulan Sacred Bird he had encountered in the human world.</p><p>Of course, there was no comparison between their powers; that Moulan Sacred Bird had only been at the Deity Transformation Stage, whereas this one was giving off fearsome spiritual pressure close to the Grand Ascension Stage, forcing even Han Li to take it seriously.</p><p>Before Han Li had a chance to think too much about this, the black-robed man opened his mouth once again to release an antiquated golden mirror, then flipped a hand over to produce a silver scroll.</p><p>The golden mirror revolved above his head at his behest, then summoned a series of identical golden mirror projections, which numbered in the thousands.</p><p>Meanwhile, the silver scroll unfurled on its own, releasing countless silver runes that transformed into 18 expressionless silver-armored warriors that were wielding different weapons.</p><p>All of them were giving off frosty auras, as if their bodies were constructed from profound ice.</p><p>"Go and kill that man!" the black-robed man roared as he stabbed a finger in Han Li's direction.</p><p>The purple phoenix immediately flew toward Han Li as a purple fiery cloud alongside the 18 armored warriors at the man's behest, while balls of golden flames erupted out of the mirror projections before crashing down in a devastating storm.</p><p>

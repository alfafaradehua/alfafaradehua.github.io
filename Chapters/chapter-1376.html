                                    <p>Chapter 1376: The Wood Tribe</p><p>From a distance, the hill looked ordinary as if there were no changes to it at all, but it was actually just an illusion.</p><p>Han Li was standing on the hill, right in front of the half-charred ancient tree.</p><p>When Han Li looked at it, he recalled what Long Dong and Xiao Hong had mentioned.</p><p>According to what they said, if it was possible, they could meet a spy planted by the humans and demons and receive information that was difficult to record. But if it was too dangerous, and they personally couldn&#39;t make the trip, the spy could be disregarded.</p><p>Now that he swept his spiritual sense past the area, it appeared that no one had come.</p><p>In this case, the assignment was actually quite simple. So long as he removes the item, the mission will be considered complete for him.</p><p>With that decided, Han Li extended his finger and swiped it at the ancient tree.</p><p>A crackle sounded and an azure sword streak shot forward, cleaving the tree into two.</p><p>It contained a white jade slip there.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s face lit up with joy and he reached out for it, summoning it into his hand.</p><p>At that moment, a muffled sound traveled through the air. A golden light suddenly pierced through the illusion, directly shooting towards the jade slip.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s face slightly changed. Without another thought, azure light flashed from his hand. A hand of azure light appeared in the air and swiped at the golden light.</p><p>A sweet giggle sound from the golden light. It broke through the azure hand like it was an illusion. The jade slip that was flying in Han Li&rsquo;s direction stopped and a faint white blur appeared to the side. She raised her hand and nimble took the jade slip.</p><p>&ldquo;Fellow Daoist Ye!&rdquo; Han Li narrowed his eyes, recognizing the true figure wrapped in white light. It was Ye Ying, the young white-robed woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Brother Han. It appears you&rsquo;ve arrived here smoothly and easily.&rdquo; The young woman flipped the jade slip in her hand and chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Did Fairy Ye encounter trouble on her way here? When I left the Southern Skyline and arrived at the edge of the forest, I waited for you all for a while and I received no messages. What happened to you?&rdquo; Han Li asked with an odd expression.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite simple. Fellow Daoist Long and I encountered a group of wind wyrms in the skyline. We had no choice but to split off. To escape them, we had no choice but to change direction. There were a few other problems along the way. That is why you didn&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo; The young woman sweetly smiled with significant grace.</p><p>Han Li felt his heart tremble. He faintly made out something from her words.</p><p>Just as he was about to ask her something, a green light flashed from the sky and charged towards them. The light faded away to reveal a man and a woman.</p><p>They were Long Dong and Xiao Hong.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As expected, you arrived here first!&rdquo;</p><p>The two spoke with a tone of surprise.</p><p>When Xiao Hong saw Han Li&rsquo;s unharmed appearance, she revealed a trace of surprise, but when Long Dong saw the white-robed woman, he revealed joy.</p><p>The white-robed woman looked at the two and casually said, &ldquo;So it was Brother Long and Fellow Daoist Ye. I wasn&rsquo;t fast, you were just slow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Lady Ye already grab ahold of the item?&rdquo; Long Dong glanced at the young woman&rsquo;s hand and wore a mysterious smile.</p><p>Xiao Hong glanced at the jade slip in the white-robed woman&rsquo;s hand and her expression faintly changed.</p><p>The young woman let out a bright laugh and leisurely said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I have it in my hand. In truth, Fellow Daoist Han came here first, but I was still a step ahead of you two.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Xiao Hong paused for a second and suddenly asked, &ldquo;Brother Han, was there only one jade slip here?&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s heart stirred, but he nodded with a calm expression.</p><p>Xiao Hong fell silent upon hearing Han Li&rsquo;s answer; Long Dong looked at the white-robed woman silently; and the white-robed woman simply looked down while fiddling with the jade slip in her hand.</p><p>For a time, silence filled the air. The heavy atmosphere was an omen for a coming storm.</p><p>Xiao Hong&rsquo;s expression relaxed and she wore a pleasant face. She asked, &ldquo;Junior Sister Ye, could you let me take a look at the jade slip? The spies we sent to the wood tribe included those from my clan. Perhaps they have some information for my clan.&rdquo;</p><p>The white-robed woman pursed her lips and then sweetly smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll be open and say that the spies had people from my Ye Clan as well. Why don&rsquo;t I take a look at it first and then tell you about it?&rdquo;</p><p>Xiao Hong&rsquo;s expression vastly changed and her smile froze. Her gaze became sullen.</p><p>Long Dong calmly said, &ldquo;Since you already have it, we shouldn&rsquo;t stay here for much longer. Let&rsquo;s hurry away and talk about it when we leave the forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; The white-robed woman said.</p><p>Xiao Hong&rsquo;s lip stirred but she raised no objections.</p><p>Han Li naturally agreed as well. The young woman smiled and her bright eyes flickered around. Just as she was about to put away the jade slip, a silver streak shot out of the ancient tree behind her. It quickly and silently streaked towards the center of her back.</p><p>Although the white-robed woman was faced around, she snorted and her body stirred. Her body grew vague and she disappeared.</p><p>A moment later, she appeared over thirty meters away, but there was a silver streak that shot then shot up from the ground.</p><p>This time, the young woman&rsquo;s expression faintly changed.</p><p>Her shoulder suddenly blurred and she shot ten meters to the side as if there were a spring underneath her, allowing her to avoid the attack.</p><p>But at that moment, the sound of tearing air blew past her.</p><p>A near indistinct line of transparent line shot out of a sprace nearby her. The target wasn&rsquo;t the young woman, but the jade slip in her hand.</p><p>Alarmed, the young woman suddenly pulled back her hand, but she was too late.</p><p>Bang! The jade slip immediately ruptured, turning into countless shards. In the young woman&rsquo;s fury, her face warped and she grabbed ahold of the transparent line and fiercely pulled it towards her.</p><p>Clang. She dragged out a huge transparent beetle out from the void.</p><p>This insect was a meter-long and resembled a huge silkworm, but there were a pair of cicada wings on its back. It fluttered for its life to break free. The end of it that spouted out the thread seemed to be its mouth.</p><p>At that moment, the young woman pulled, keeping the insect there.</p><p>In the instant the jade slip was destroyed, Han Li and the others were blank in surprise.</p><p>At nearly the same time, the remaining ancient trees lit up in green light. Soon after, the ancient tree&rsquo;s hollow images were dissolved to be replaced with several green silhouettes. It appeared as if they were born from the trees.</p><p>A towering silhouette swept their gaze past Han Li and spoke human words in a harsh tone, &ldquo;Hehe, I didn&rsquo;t expect that it was hidden there. If you weren&rsquo;t guiding us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have found it. Our clan won&rsquo;t have to worry about later consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Han Li glanced at the figure&rsquo;s appearance and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>The person resembled a human, but their skin was green and their eyes were purple. Other than that, they appeared human. Two of the slender figures resembled women.</p><p>These silhouettes were wood tribe beings.</p><p>What was most astonishing to Han Li was the orange belt they wore at their waist around their long robes.</p><p>The belt of the towering being was yellow orange with a silver stripe.</p><p>According to what he knew of their grades, Han Li felt his heart plummet.</p><p>&ldquo;A silver tier! You&rsquo;re a silver tier tree spirit!&rdquo; When they recognized the towering figure&rsquo;s belt, the young woman&rsquo;s expression turned unsightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the lower silver tier spirit master Mu Rui. Since you&rsquo;ve arrived here, there is no need to leave. Allow my clan to welcome you!&rdquo; The towering figure spoke expressionlessly and waved his hand.</p><p>The other orange belted tree beings crouched down and placed their hands against the ground.</p><p>A layer of green light suddenly shot out from the hill in every direction at inconceivable speeds.</p><p>Han Li and the white-robed woman immediately took off from the ground without another thought.</p><p>A huge rumbling sound shook the air and the illusion restriction Han Li placed down was effortlessly destroyed.</p><p>Once the illusion was dispersed, the hill&rsquo;s surroundings were made clear.</p><p>Wherever the green light passed, green trees would turn into towering furred beasts. They had a variety of weapons on hand. Their fur had many differing colors as well. There were even monstrous winds that blew into the sky.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, there were several thousands of beasts that densely surrounded the hill.</p><p>Long Dong and Xiao Hong&rsquo;s face turned bloodlessly pale.</p><p>Han Li wryly smiled. Only the white-robed woman sullenly glared at Mu Rui. It was unknown what she was thinking.</p><p>Mu Rui wore a stiff expression, but he spoke with a derisive tone, &ldquo;These are the Tree Ape Beasts that our tribe spent a thousand years researching. If you looked through that jade slip, you should&rsquo;ve had information about them, but now...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Attack!&rdquo;</p><p>An unfamiliar voice suddenly sounded. Before Han Li and the others realized what was happening, the white-robed young woman suddenly opened her mouth and released a crimson blood light. Suddenly, it turned into several threads and directly shot towards the wood spirits excluding the silver-tier wood spirit.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1375.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1377.html">Next</a></li>

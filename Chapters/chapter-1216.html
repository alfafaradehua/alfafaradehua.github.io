                                    <p><span>The jet-black octagonal hammer simply emitted a thread of sparkling blue flame in response to being caught by the cauldron. The chilliness the flame emitted was downright eerie.</span></p><p><span>Although Han Li couldn't tell just how powerful the devil flames were, they were by no means ordinary.</span></p><p><span>Blue flame wrapped around the Heavenvoid Cauldron and rigidly trapped it in the air without the slightest show of effort. No matter how fiercely the cauldron flames burned, the blue thread was completely unaffected.</span></p><p><span>Han Li ignored what was happening above him and turned his sights on the four black streaks that were shooting towards him.</span></p><p><span>“The Devil Sages?” Han Li muttered silently. A trace of a smile appeared on his face and he shook his sleeve.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, several rolls of thunder sounded out, followed by four dense bolts of lightning arcing out from his sleeve. In a flash, they accurately struck the four black streaks.</span></p><p><span>Several explosions sounded out as four blinding golden flashes ruptured, drowning out the black streaks in an instant. The devil phantoms seemed to have met their weakness and quickly evaporated like morning dew.</span></p><p><span>This had taken Han Li only a token effort.</span></p><p><span>In the mere blink of an eye, the azure silhouette behind Han Li raised its hand and produced a small crimson bow in its hand, drawing it back.</span></p><p><span>A deafening boom shook the air. Blinding red light and countless arrows of flame were released, filling the sky with its barrage.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, the spike-covered devil saw a skyful of arrows shooting towards it and looked on with fear. It let out a large shout and its body glowed with crimson light.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When the spiked devil finished taking its defensive actions, the barrage struck its barriers.</span></p><p><span>Countless arrows ruptured on impact and the devil was submerged in flames. Explosions shook the air for a long while, in a display of their terrifying power.</span></p><p><span>However, the devil within the flames remained unscathed inside its crimson barriers. It took a deep breath and it waved their silver arms, intending on cutting away the crimson flames that surrounded it.</span></p><p><span>Then, the sounds of thunder struck.</span></p><p><span>In the devil’s fright, it discovered that a green arrow was shooting towards them in an arc of lightning.</span></p><p><span>Although the devil didn’t know the arrow was precisely, it blurred from sight in an attempt to dodge it.</span></p><p><span>But what the devil failed to sense while they were distracted by the arrow was the black crystal knife that strangely appeared above them. As silently as it appeared, it dropped down and slid itself toward its head.</span></p><p><span>The spiked devil hadn’t noticed a thing.</span></p><p><span>Suddenly, the azure silhouette halted their attack and the endless barrage of flame arrows came to a halt.</span></p><p><span>Baffled by this change and still evading the green arrows, a black streak silently circled one of the devil’s necks like a bolt of lightning and its triangular head toppled of its neck.</span></p><p><span>The crimson light barrier may as well have been air.</span></p><p><span>This came as no surprise. The knife was refined from a Devil Essence Diamond, an extremely rare material condensed for countless years from pure devilish Qi. How could a barrier quickly formed from devil Qi hope to block it?</span></p><p><span>With Han Li’s second Nascent Soul residing in the human-like puppet, it didn’t require any instruction. In the instant, the dagger executed the devil, it rushed forward to the devil’s corpse.</span></p><p><span>It opened its mouth and a cloud of black light rushed out from it, enveloping the corpse.</span></p><p><span>Then, it dragged out a phantom from the body that had a striking resemblance to the devil. The phantom was so dim that it looked like it could disperse at any moment.</span></p><p><span>It was then dragged back into the puppet’s mouth in the cloud and absorbed by the second Nascent Soul residing inside of it.</span></p><p><span>The pure devilish Qi would prove to be significant to the cultivation of the Zenith Yin Arts.</span></p><p><span>With the phantom absorbed, the headless devil corpse dissolved into ash with a gentle wind.</span></p><p><span>Then in a blur, the puppet returned to Han Li’s side with its arms behind its back.</span></p><p><span>From a distance, if it weren’t for the difference of their clothes, it would appear as if there were two of Han Li standing side by side.</span></p><p><span>At the moment, Han Li was fiddling with his Triflame Fan as he calmly looked across from him.</span></p><p><span>Han Li indifferently said, “Fellow Daoist Six Paths, I’ve already seen your Six Apex Devils technique. If you don’t have any else to impress me with, I will be sending you off.”</span></p><p><span>When Archsaint Six Paths heard this, his face grew pale and disbelief was betrayed from his eyes.</span></p><p><span>Two of the late Nascent Soul-stage demons he regarded as his trump cards were exterminated with ease. It was beyond belief.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, his opponent was able to make use of the flame fan, the small azure cauldron, and the green wooden ruler; each of these treasures possessed an immense power. Let alone the famous Heavenvoid Cauldron and Han Li’s use of the incarnation techniques, he didn’t have the slightest information on the other two grand treasures. But what was particularly bizarre was that his unfathomable incarnation alone was able to slay one of his devils.</span></p><p><span>His heart dropped.</span></p><p><span>How was this possible? Han Li should’ve only been at late-Nascent Soul stage for about a hundred years at most. For him to master these profound techniques and acquire these grand treasures in such a short amount of time.</span></p><p><span>Although he had never seen a Deity Transformation-stage cultivator, he had no doubt that Han Li’s current abilities were close to one.</span></p><p><span>When the old devil heard Han Li’s words, his back trembled and his eyes narrowed. Then he opened his mouth and a scarf of black mist roiled out.</span></p><p><span>The object quickly blurred and immediately covered him in black wind.</span></p><p><span>The winds let out a shrieking whistle before letting out a tremble and kiting backwards, carrying the old devil with them.</span></p><p><span>The black wind became vague and flew at immense speed. Several blurs later, it left a chain of afterimages.</span></p><p><span>In an instant, the wind strangely appeared an even greater distance away. There even was a remnant of black wind in its original position.</span></p><p><span>As a result, there were several balls of black wind present, all capable of teleporting away. In the blink of an eye, they could travel over three hundred meters away. A normal late-Nascent Soul cultivator would feel helpless against such bizarre movements.</span></p><p><span>Of course, Han Li wasn’t an ordinary late-Nascent Soul cultivator by any means. When he saw this, he wore an odd expression, “So you’re actually running away. Your bonded magic treasure seems quite good at it. If it were before, I fear I may have had some trouble. But now, ha...”</span></p><p><span>Han Li took a deep sigh and the Thunderstorm Wings trembled behind his back, letting out a roll of thunder. Arcs of white and azure lightning appeared on the wing’s surface. Soon after, &nbsp;they formed balls of lightning in the surrounding air, spinning in place.</span></p><p><span>As he stretched out his wings, he floated in the air, drifting slightly to the side.</span></p><p><span>At the moment, he was looking in the distance at the black blur that was Archsaint Six Paths. He snorted and fanned his wings once.</span></p><p><span>Gales immediately erupted around him and the suspended balls of lightning raged, striking together.</span></p><p><span>Azure-white lightning erupted in deafening booms, only for the gales to gather all of it into the two wings.</span></p><p><span>Covered in a layer of lightning, the Thunderstorm Wings wildly flapped several times, followed by Han Li disappearing from his original location in a flash of azure-white lightning.</span></p><p><span>A breath later, lightning sparked a hundred meters away, and it happened again after a pause, each time, heading a hundred meters further out. Its speed was quite faster than the old devil’s black winds.</span></p><p><span>In several blinks, the lightning pursued the black wind until it was only thirty meters away.</span></p><p><span>As Han Li rode the lightning, he could clearly see the old devil’s face of terror within the black wind.</span></p><p><span>With another wave of his wings, another clap of thunder roared, and he arrived in front of the black wind in an azure-white flash.</span></p><p><span>The lightning faded to reveal Han Li blocking the old devil’s path.</span></p><p><span>The black gales came to a brief stop, only to quickly change direction.</span></p><p><span>At that moment, Han Li sneered and held his hands in an incantation gesture and lightning clapped from within him. His stature burst several inches in size, grew thicker, with four arms jutting out from his flesh. Golden light lit up on his skin only for a moment before disappearing.</span></p><p><span>In the blink of an eye, he turned into a large man of immense strength and stature. This was the transformation after making use of the third layer of the Brightjade Arts.</span></p><p><span>With this transformation done, he raised his hands, summoning purple flames in his hands, and he held them together to form a large purple saber of flame.</span></p><p><span>Afterward, the wings on his back strangely trembled and he shot forward.</span></p><p><span>But his body strangely warped the moment he set off and his wings trembled with inconceivable frequency, causing the nearby air to warp with its movements. He disappeared in a white line along the way.</span></p><p><span>When the old devil saw this, he knew things were turning out for the worst. Seeing that he could no longer flee, he concentrated the magic power in his body and caused the black wind surrounding him to surge in size. At the same time, he flipped his hand, producing a crimson shield in front of him.</span></p><p><span>Just as he was about to activate it, a white line appeared above him and vanished as soon as it had appeared.</span></p><p><span>Following that was the old devil’s loud yell.</span></p><p><span>The crimson shield now fell to the ground along with the part of his arm, the rest of his arm covered in purple ice.</span></p><p><span>The stump of an arm was smooth and sleek, leaving not a drop of blood behind.</span></p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1215.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1217.html">Next</a></li>

It then disappeared into his sleeve with a flash of white light.</p><p>Han Li lowered his hand and wore a tranquil expression, saying, &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s have a chat!&rdquo;</p><p>Having been struck down just a moment ago without the slightest resistance or contest, Yun Tianxiao had lost the will to fight.</p><p>After a short moment, Yun Tianxiao managed to stand up with his blood-covered body. He glanced at Han Li with a gaze full of fright.</p><p>With a pale face, Yun Tianxiao said, &ldquo;Well, since I cannot stop you, feel free to take Wen Siyue away. However, let&rsquo;s get the unpleasant matters out of the way first. She already caught the eye of a Senior and was being prepared as a cultivation vessel. After you take her away, don&rsquo;t be afraid of any calamities you attract.&rdquo; Soon after, he took out several talismans and slapped them onto his body. With a flashes of green light, his wounds healed at a visible rate.</p><p>&lsquo;Cultivation vessel?&rsquo; Han Li suddenly realized why Wen Siyue desired to depart.</p><p>However, Han Li&rsquo;s expression suddenly grew cold from the implicit meaning of Yun Tianxiao&rsquo;s words.</p><p>Han Li said with an unchanged expression, &ldquo;There is someone else that fancies her? That&rsquo;s no problem. I&rsquo;ll take her anyways. Though, it would be better if Fellow Daoist kept his threats to a minimum. Otherwise, blood will be shed if my mood takes a turn for the worse.&rdquo; He then casually swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s threats weren&rsquo;t entirely plausible. If it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that so many Core Formation cultivators were present, Han Li would&rsquo;ve clearly killed the lot of them to tie up all the loose ends. However, he wasn&rsquo;t completely confident in being able to kill them all. As such, he could only use his heavy words to intimidate those that were present.</p><p>If his previous attack had left the others bewildered, then his current tone had aroused suspicion that Han Li was a Nascent Soul cultivator. The cultivators present became anxious and they quickly lowered their heads. None dared to meet Han Li&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>Yun Tianxiao naturally also thought of this possibility. He appeared to be an early Core Formation cultivator, but had nearly taken his life with a single strike. Additionally, he wanted to find the nest of a grade eight demon beast. When he made the connection, he suddenly began to inwardly curse without end.</p><p>Wen Siyue, still in Han Li&rsquo;s embrace, suddenly widened her beautiful eyes and her body jolted straight.</p><p>She would rather die than become someone else&rsquo;s cultivation vessel. As a result, she had decided to risk her life in that previous display. However, she completely hadn&rsquo;t expected this cultivator surnamed Li to possess such a frightening cultivation. He was able to suppress all the cultivators present by himself and in a single terrifying move, he gravely injured Yun Tianxiao and left Lady Fan with a faceful of terror. This was all such a delightful surprise, it felt like something that would come out of a dream.</p><p>Han Li glanced at the others&rsquo; careful and meek mannerisms and coldly smiled.</p><p>He then raised his hand and summoned the dark skinned cultivator&rsquo;s copper plate to his hand. Han Li began to examine it without a trace of politeness.</p><p>The dark-skinned cultivator&rsquo;s expression faintly changed. However, his mouth trembled several times, only to remain silent. He didn&rsquo;t dare to say any words of dissatisfaction. Since Han Li was able to nearly deal Yun Tianxiao a killing blow in a single strike, he naturally knew that he didn&rsquo;t pose a chance and turned his expression away.</p><p>Han Li put down the copper plate and indifferently spoke to its owner, &ldquo;I want this item. How many spirit stones for it?&rdquo;</p><p>The dark-skinned cultivator was slightly surprised and instinctively responded, &ldquo;Seven&hellip; No, five thousand spirit stones!&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li then took out a grade five demon core and promptly dropped it in front of the other person.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use the demon core to trade for it&rdquo;, Han Li then turned to Lady Fan and said, &ldquo;Moreover, don&rsquo;t say that I robbed you of this woman. The materials on the table can be considered payment for her.&rdquo; Han Li patted the shoulder of Wen Siyue and let go of her. He then stood up and unhurriedly walked towards the exit.</p><p>Wen Siyue finally woke up a short moment later and hurried after him in a somewhat flustered manner.</p><p>Lady Fan&rsquo;s expression stirred and she suddenly yelled, &ldquo;Senior Li, please slow down!&rdquo;</p><p>Han Li halted his steps, and he turned around with an odd expression on his face.</p><p>Han Li found it quite interesting that the woman was actually courageous enough to call out to him. Wen Siyue grew nervous at this and unconsciously drew closer to Han Li.</p><p>Han Li narrowed his eyes and indifferently asked, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Senior wish to return to the Inner Star Seas? Our Exquisite Sound Sect will have a method of returning everyone to the Inner Star Seas in the near future.&rdquo; Lady Fan sweetly smiled, speaking with an obviously respectful tone. As it was very likely the she was speaking to a Nascent Soul cultivator, she didn&rsquo;t dare to be negligent.</p><p>Han Li frowned and asked, &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t interested in hearing elusive words.</p><p>Seeing that Han Li was still patient, she didn&rsquo;t dare to put up any pretenses and hastily said, &ldquo;Our Exquisite Sound Sect is currently preparing a transportation formation to return to the Inner Star Seas. We are currently lacking a few crucial materials. As the formation cannot be completed without them, we hosted this trade meeting in the hopes of acquiring everyone&rsquo;s assistance. So long as you assist in the creation of the transportation formation, our Exquisite Sound Sect will send you back to the Inner Star Seas free of charge.&rdquo;</p><p>Lady Fan&rsquo;s words caused the other Core Formation cultivators to become restless. A majority of them revealed pleasant surprise. The Outer Star Seas had already become the dominion of demon beasts. They couldn&rsquo;t stay here for much longer. As such, they had naturally thought of returning. However, there were no transportation formations, and it would take more than six hundred years to return at the speed of their flight, not to mention the many dangers they would encounter along the way. They remained here only out of an inability to leave.</p><p>The white-haired old woman&rsquo;s expression stirred and she coldly asked, &ldquo;Even with the transportation formation, won&rsquo;t we need displacement talismans? Don&rsquo;t tell us that the Exquisite Sound Sect has already grasped how to refine them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t be worried. Although our Exquisite Sound Sect cannot refine these talismans, we acquired quite a few of them before the Beast Torrent. We currently have more than enough to send everyone back to the Scattered Star Seas. The most important material for the formation is Phantasm Stone. It is truly rare. Although we&rsquo;ve found a deposit of this stone during our search for it over these past few years, it happens to be located near the resting area of a group of high grade demon beasts. A majority of them are at grade five and six, and they are great in number. It isn&rsquo;t something that can be done with a small number of cultivators. Moreover, if any of them are allowed to escape, they will alert higher grade demon beasts, resulting in disaster. Thus, our sect requires everyone&rsquo;s strength!&rdquo; Lady Fan spoke with a righteous expression.</p><p>After hearing this, the others wore a pensive expression. Cleanly exterminating a group of demon beasts wasn&rsquo;t something that could be easily agreed to. They had to carefully think about it.</p><p>The dark-skinned cultivator muttered to himself for a moment before slowly asking, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask a Nascent Soul cultivator for assistance instead of Core Formation cultivators? The certainty of success would&rsquo;ve been higher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you Fellow Daoists think that I didn&rsquo;t try? However, most of those venerable Seniors had completely vanished after the Beast Torrent. I was only able to get into contact with Senior Swift Crane. With that person joining us, we would&rsquo;ve been able to deal with the grade seven demon beasts. He was the one who fancied Siyue to be his cultivation vessel.&rdquo; Lady Fan bitterly smiled and glanced in Han Li&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>When the other cultivators heard this, they looked at each other in dismay.</p><p>When Han Li heard this, he rubbed his chin and muttered to himself for a moment. He then promptly said, &ldquo;I have no interest in this endeavor. Deal with it yourselves.&rdquo; With that said, he ignored them and headed out.</p><p>Wen Siyue didn&rsquo;t dare to fall behind and quickly followed after him.</p><p>Nobody dared to block Han Li. They could only gaze after him as he left.</p><p>Lady Fan wore an expression of unconcealed disappointment.</p><p>As for Yun Tianxiao, he finally began to speak once more, &ldquo;Since Fellow Daoist Li is unwilling to assist us, we won&rsquo;t force any of you either. We will now introduce some information on the demon beasts nearby the Phantasm Stone. Please come to your own decisions after the details have been explained. Here&hellip;&rdquo; As if he hadn&rsquo;t been heavily injured, Yun Tianxiao began to ceaselessly speak.&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Senior, do you truly not wish to return to the Inner Star Seas?&rdquo; Wen Siyue muttered from behind Han Li.</p><p>Without turning his head around, Han Li aloofly replied, &ldquo;Why? Do you want to return?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t wish to, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Wen Siyue&rsquo;s voice grew soft until she ceased speaking.</p><p>At that moment, Han Li had already brought her past the stone wall. Since his objective had already been accomplished, he naturally had no interest in staying here any longer.</p><p>Han Li brought Wen Siyue outside of the concealed city, much to the astonishment of the old gatekeeper. He then wrapped the woman in his light and took off into the skies.</p><p>Wen Siyue was silent as they flew, and didn&rsquo;t ask him any questions about their destination. It seemed she was leaving everything entirely up to Han Li.</p><p>Han Li also hadn&rsquo;t thought to give her any further explanation and continued to fly in stifled silence.</p><p>Two days later, Han Li eventually found a desolate island with meager spiritual Qi and descended.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-538.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-540.html">Next</a></li>

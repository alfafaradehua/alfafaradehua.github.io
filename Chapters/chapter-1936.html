                                    <p>However, the tip of the spear only managed to pierce several inches into the golden body's body chest before being stopped cold in its tracks. At the same time, six golden blades appeared in the golden body's hands again before being slashed toward the massive spear.</p><p>The devilish projection down below seemed to have also sensed that something was amiss, and it immediately attempted to withdraw the giant spear, but it was already too late.</p><p>A layer of translucent light appeared over the surface of the Provenance Golden Body, and a burst of immense suction force immediately acted upon the giant spear, thereby completely immobilizing it.</p><p>Right at this moment, countless blade projections rained down from the six golden blades being wielded by the golden body, and the projections came crashing down in a torrential wave that threatened to inundate both the devilish projection and Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang.</p><p>Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang harrumphed coldly upon seeing this before taking a half-step backward, then made a strange hand seal that was accompanied by an unintelligible incantation.</p><p>A buzzing sound rang out from the small canoe, and a crimson light barrier emerged to protect both Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang and the devilish projection.</p><p>The blade projections rained down upon the light barrier like a violent storm, but the barrier remained completely stable and unscathed.</p><p>Not only was this canoe an extremely powerful flying treasure, it also possessed incredible defensive abilities. It was no wonder that Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was so calm and collected in the face of the Provenance Golden Body's attacks. All of a sudden, the devilish projection raised its head and let loose a low roar, upon which a layer of grey light flashed over the giant spear that was immobilized against the golden body's chest. As a result, the spear softened and transformed into a grey devilish python that was several hundred feet in length. The python had an inky-black horn on its head, and it lashed out with its massive body to wind itself tightly around the golden body. </p><p>If a normal Body Integration cultivator had been caught in the python's stranglehold, their body would instantly explode. However, the Provenance Golden Body was manifested from countless precious materials, and it was virtually indestructible. As such, not only did it manage to remain completely unscathed even as it was bound by the giant python, it suddenly began to expand. At the same time, the six golden blades it was wielding vanished in a flash, and as it waved its six arms through the air, countless golden fist projections were sent hurtling toward the massive python.</p><p>A string of rumbling booms rang out, and the giant python also seemed to possess an extremely resolute body; even though it was sustaining some damage from the golden fist projections, it was able to withstand the blows without too much trouble.</p><p>In retaliation, it opened its mouth and expelled a burst of green Qi directly toward one of the golden body's three heads.</p><p>The green Qi immediately struck the golden body with an overpowering sense of drowsiness, and the expressions on its three faces changed slightly as golden light suddenly flashed from its glabella. A gash was then opened up, and a third vertical eye emerged.</p><p>Golden light flashed, and three streaks of piercing golden light shot forth from within the vertical eye before passing through the green Qi in a flash.</p><p>Strangely enough, the green Qi was completely eradicated as a result.</p><p>The giant python swung its head around and attempted to chomp down viciously onto the golden body's center head, but a huge shimmering golden hand appeared in its path before lashing out in retaliation.</p><p>Thus, the golden body and the massive python began to engage in a melee brawl, and both of them possessed extremely powerful bodies, so it seemed that this was going to be quite a long battle.</p><p>Meanwhile, the giant pagoda projection above the sword formation was flickering unsteadily under the influence of the Nine Palaces Heavenly Talisman, as well as the detonation of another low-grade spatial treasure. The rainbow light that it released was disrupted, and in the end, it fizzled out of existence before it could reach the sword formation.</p><p>Similarly, the palatial projections conjured up by the Nine Palaces Heavenly Talismans were also affected by the pagoda's spatial powers, thereby preventing them from descending as well.</p><p>Right at this moment, a peculiar light suddenly flashed through Han Li's eyes, and abruptly thrust both of his palms up into the air.</p><p>Two mountains, one black and one azure, emerged out of thin air amid a pair of resounding booms. Each mountain was several hundred feet tall, and they both crashed directly toward the clone that was controlling the rainbow pagoda.</p><p>Meanwhile, the spirit body swept one of its sleeves through the air to release a plume of green threads. These green threads were virtually completely transparent, and they vanished into thin air before abruptly reappearing near the small pagoda, then descended as a net of green threads.</p><p>It appeared that Han Li was attempting to take this treasure as well.</p><p>The clone of Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang remained completely expressionless upon seeing this; he merely raised a hand toward the small pagoda that was hovering in mid-air, and uttered the word "break".</p><p>The small pagoda rotated on the spot, and a gust of fierce rainbow winds erupted from within it. The oncoming green net was instantly torn apart by this gust of wind, and on top of that, the two extreme mountains were also blown back by over 100 feet.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, the rainbow winds completely enveloped the two extreme mountains, following which countless mysterious golden symbols that were very familiar to Han Li appeared around the pair of mountains.</p><p>"Golden seal text!" Han Li exclaimed as his expression changed slightly. Immediately thereafter, a burst of mysterious power suddenly descended upon the two mountains, attempting to forcibly cut off his spiritual sense connection with them.</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that his spiritual sense was virtually as powerful as that of a Grand Ascension cultivator, the connection he had with the two extreme mountains most likely really would've been severed.</p><p>Han Li immediately let loose a roar of shock and fury as he launched his giant furry fists toward the gust of rainbow wind, and two giant golden fist projections emerged out of thin air before crashing heavily into the gust of wind.</p><p>At the same time, a row of silver runes abruptly lit up on the Extreme Essencefused Mountain at his behest, and the mountain expelled a burst of grey light that swept violently toward the rainbow winds.</p><p>Simultaneously, countless streaks of transparent sword Qi were erupting from the other extreme mountain, and these streaks of sword Qi were threatening to tear even the nearby space apart.</p><p>The gust of rainbow wind was extremely powerful, but when the three powers clashed, the rainbow wind tremored violently before disintegrating into specks of piercing light amid a dull thump.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two extreme mountains shot back toward Han Li, and the clone that was controlling the pagoda was quite surprised to see that it had been unable to forcibly take the two extreme mountains from Han Li.</p><p>However, the hint of surprise in his eyes quickly faded, and he made a grabbing motion in an expressionless manner. Spatial fluctuations erupted, and a ball of spiritual light emerged, contained within which was the small Rainbow Light Pagoda.</p><p>All of a sudden, a cold voice rang out from the distance. "Hmph, this brat sure has some tricks up his sleeve. Don't hold back any longer; unleash the Rainbow Light Pagoda's ultimate ability and kill him! Even if he detonates more spatial treasures, he won't be able to disrupt that ability."</p><p>The voice belonged to none other than Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang.</p><p>At present, he was controlling the devilish projection behind him as it was engaged in ferocious combat with the Provenance Golden Body, but the fact that he was still able to issue instructions to his clones clearly indicated that he still had more to give.</p><p>Han Li's heart stirred upon hearing this, and he let loose a thunderous roar as dazzling golden spiritual light radiated from his massive ape body. His arms blurred as he swung them through the air, flinging the two extreme mountains directly toward Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang.</p><p>The two mountains were extraordinarily heavy, and they had been launched by the insane strength of the Giant Mountain Ape. All of a sudden, they vanished into thin air, then reappeared right in front of Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang before crashing heavily into the crimson light barrier released by the small canoe.</p><p>Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's pupils contracted upon seeing this, and the giant devilish projection behind him instantly transformed into a ball of crimson light that completely enveloped his body. </p><p>Two earth-shattering booms rang out, and the crimson light barrier shuddered violently before being shattered like porcelain.</p><p>The two mountains continued onward and crashed right through the ball of crimson light, but Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted around 200 feet away, and Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang re-emerged.</p><p>However, he had donned a suit of grey devilish armor, and two pairs of crimson wings had appeared on his back. At the same time, a circle of eight fist-sized azure ghostly heads had appeared around his neck.</p><p>All of the ghostly heads' eyes were tightly shut, and they were extremely menacing in appearance. On top of that, their mouths were constantly opening and closing as if they were living creatures, creating quite a harrowing sight to behold.</p><p>Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang wore an enraged expression as he glowered at Han Li with intense resentment in his eyes.</p><p>"I didn't think that I would be forced to display this form to you. I must say, you've done very well!"</p><p>As he was glowering at Han Li, the clone that was controlling the small pagoda suddenly raised the Rainbow Light Pagoda high up into the air, then slowly closed his eyes and began to chant an ancient incantation.</p><p>A loud buzzing sound rang out from the rainbow pagoda, and rainbow halos began to proliferate from it, quickly spreading to encompass the entire space around an acre in size in the surrounding area.</p><p>As the clone's chanting quickened, a series of golden runes of different sizes also emerged from within the rainbow light, and bursts of fluctuations that were imbued with hints of the power of laws of heaven and earth began to fill the entire sky.</p><p>

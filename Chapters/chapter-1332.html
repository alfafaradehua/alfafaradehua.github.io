                                    <p>Chapter 1332: Savage Beastman</p><p>&ldquo;A Savage Beastman! Quickly kill him! We cannot allow him to join with the beast.&rdquo; When they saw this strange person, Daoist Priest Man shouted in terror.</p><p>When the others heard this, they were aghast.</p><p>Without another thought, they released rarely seen ancient treasures in streaks of light.</p><p>In a moment, the beastman and the ancient beast was pelted by attacks.</p><p>Han Li saw that his subordinates were truly fearful of this foreign tribe.</p><p>To the confusion of the cultivators in the squad, Han Li still hadn&rsquo;t taken action. As the beastman was on the verge of transformation, he continued to float in the air with his hands behind the back, leaving the fight completely to them.</p><p>As the cultivators felt somewhat stressed, the beastman suddenly counterattacked, blocking them from asking Han Li.</p><p>The beastman let out a strange laugh and its shoulder blurred, creating a yellow tornado in the direction of the cultivators. As for the ancient beast, its body began to turn exceptionally green, soon extended its tentacles.</p><p>They spread out in green blurs, striking at the air along with the tornado.</p><p>Regardless of the magic treasures&rsquo; attacks, be they lightning, flame, or swordlight, they were all swept into the tornado and disappeared. And when they were struck by the tentacles, they were repelled.</p><p>The cultivators acted in a panic, unable to cope with what was happening.</p><p>As Han Li looked on without lifting a finger, no one noticed the small silver fish in the pond had begun to form two orbs. They sparkled with silver light as if it in the form of silver eyes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the calm surface of the water began to violently stir, exposing a transparent ten-meter-large mouth. It had crystalline ice-like fangs.</p><p>The pond had turned into a monster with a transparent body.</p><p>At that moment the huge transparent monster stirred and pounced at Han Li in midair.</p><p>Not only was it transparent, but its movements were silent as if it were formless.</p><p>Han Li silently looked at the battle that was unfolding between the beastman as if he hadn&rsquo;t noticed himself being attacked.</p><p>Just as the transparent beast was ten meters away from Han Li, its silver eyes flashed and it bared its fangs at Han Li.</p><p>Grey light flashed from Han Li&rsquo;s back, and countless thin lines of Divine Essencefused Light directly shot at it.</p><p>Alarmed, the huge beast thought to dodge, but it was too late!</p><p>With the sound of pattering rain, the grey lines pierced through the huge beast&rsquo;s body and twisted, firmly wrapped around the beast&rsquo;s body.</p><p>Han Li&rsquo;s body then blurred, turning to the huge beast. With a brief glance, he opened his mouth and spat out a small black mountain.</p><p>It twirled in the air, surging several times in size until it was a three-hundred-meter tall mountain above the transparent beast.</p><p>The beast knew things were far from good and it promptly shook its body violently in an attempt to escape.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was a water-attributed beast. With a body of the five elements, it couldn&#39;t hope to escape the bindings of the Divine Essensefused Light.</p><p>The grey lines simply swayed a bit and tightened.</p><p>At last, Han Li uttered an incantation.</p><p>A roiling sound filled the air and the mountain dropped, crushing the transparent beast underneath.</p><p>The impact vibrated the air.</p><p>The mountain crushed the transparent beast into the earth, ensuring it was entirely trapped.</p><p>He then took an expressionless look at the beast.</p><p>However, a loud scream from behind him caught his attention and he slowly turned around with a frown.</p><p>The cultivators were still busy in their battle with the beastman, but when the beastman saw the transparent monster restrained by Han Li, it let out a panicked roar.</p><p>The beastman no longer controlled the tornado or tangled with the green-eyed man. Instead, he slapped the beast below him and quickly sank inside the giant beast.</p><p>&ldquo;Not good, he&rsquo;s about to merge with it. Quickly stop him!&rdquo; The large green-eyed man rejoiced at seeing Han Li silently restrain the other beast, but his face grew tense at seeing what the beastman had done.</p><p>Youth Ying and the others were all alarmed and poured as much of their spiritual power into their treasures as they could, doubling all their efforts into attacking.</p><p>But even without direction, the tornado still hindered their attacks for a time. In that delay, the skin of the huge beast shined with green light and bumps appeared on the surface of its body.</p><p>First a pair of legs, then hands appeared. Finally, its body lengthened and a bald head grew.</p><p>Under the control of the beastman, the huge beast turned into a black giant that was a hundred meters tall. Its body was covered in purple-black scales and it had ominous green lanterns for eyes.</p><p>When it appeared, it wordlessly raised its hand into the air and fiercely pounded down with black light flashing from its fist.</p><p>Booms thundered and a dozen magic treasures were crushed into dust. A majority of them, however, managed to escape high into the air with a wail.</p><p>Fairy Xu raised her brow and snorted. Only she deemed to continue her attack and pointed at her snow-white flying sword.</p><p>Letting out a keen ring, it turned ten-meters-long and blurred, instantly disappearing.</p><p>In the following moment, it reappeared twenty meters above the giant and fiercely chopped down.</p><p>She actually planned on beheading the giant in a lone effort.</p><p>But greatly against her expectations, the giant was incredibly fast despite its huge size. As soon as the sword moved, it opened its mouth and blew back the sword with a gale.</p><p>Soon, it firmly grabbed ahold of the sword with its black-purple hand.</p><p>A malevolent expression appeared on the giant&rsquo;s face as it pressed its other palm against the sword.</p><p>It appeared to want to destroy the flying sword.</p><p>Fairy Xu&rsquo;s face turned pale.</p><p>The sword was her personally bonded magic treasure. If it was destroyed, she would suffer backlash from her mental bond with it.</p><p>She was executing spell seals in utmost haste to free it, but despite its violent trembling and the series of white icy Qi, the giant kept its grip steady.</p><p>The giant took a deep breath. Just as it was about to press down, space fluctuated nearby. A dense beam of black light struck the giant&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>In a baffling display, the attack seemed trivially small compared to its giant body, but its tumble several steps back.</p><p>The black beam of light only appeared for an instant, and from where it appeared followed a silver flame bird. The fist-sized bird dived at the giant with its wings spread.</p><p>Again, the difference in size was incredible, but it stepped back with a fearful expression upon seeing it. Rather than standing firm, it immediately turned around in a mad run.</p><p>The giant only took two steps before a sharp wind sounded from below the nearby ground. A dozen red threads flew out and surrounded the giant&rsquo;s step. Red light glowed, turning into dense flaming ropes holding down the giant&rsquo;s legs.</p><p>No longer able to move forward, the giant swiped down in furious alarm, wanting to break the flame ropes.</p><p>The silver flame bird never gave it the chance. It swooped forward at lightning speed and struck the giant&rsquo;s back as a ball of silver flames.</p><p>A muffled crackle snapped, and silver fire spread as the giant was covered in oil. It spread quickly and lit it ablaze.</p><p>Yet unable to free itself, the giant could only scream in pain and swept yellow winds around itself, trying to extinguish the flames.</p><p>When yellow wind and silver flames touched one another, the wind itself seemed to be lit up. In only a few short breathes, the giant was thoroughly enveloped by both flames and ignited winds.</p><p>Soon, the screams stopped and the giant fell onto the ground. The body had been burned to a crisp, leaving no trace of the giant&rsquo;s existence.</p><p>The black beam of light had unexpectedly appeared afterwards and arrived where the giant once was. The entire scene was witnessed by the squad of cultivators.</p><p>Although Han Li already used his Spirit Engulfing Flames once before on the sharp worms, it hadn&rsquo;t been in a display as fearsome as this. Now that the cultivators had seen it used on the helpless beastman, they were all mesmerized with disbelief on their faces.</p><p>At that moment, Han Li blurred, arriving above the silver flames and beckoning to it.</p><p>The silver flames suddenly condensed into a ball and returned back to him in the form of a firebird. As for the fire ropes, they returned into his sleeve in read threads.</p><p>Han Li swept his sights to the transparent beast being suppressed by the Divine Essensefused Mountain, and said, &ldquo;Take back the Savage Beastman and have the Foreign Spirit Hall deal with it when we go back to the city.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Junior Ma will immediately retrieve it!&rdquo; The heart of the large green-eyed man trembled and he acknowledged the command. Then with a flip of his hand, he released a white gourd.</p><p>The gourd was inscribed with large quantities of silver runes. It is a specially refined magic tool meant for temporarily detaining foreign beings.</p><p>Regardless of the tribe of their many abilities, so long as they aren&rsquo;t at true spirit grade, they can be captured by the gourd.</p><p>Of course, the beastman had now lost its strength and was completely motionless. It no longer put up a resistance.</p>                                	<li><a href="chapter-1331.html">Previous</a></li><li><a href="chapter-1333.html">Next</a></li>

                                    <h3>Chapter 2385: Buddha Bone Monarch</h3><p>Several bands of purplish-golden light appeared over Han Li's body, and the world's origin Qi he had just absorbed surged into the giant green sword in his grasp in a frenzy.</p><p>A row of silver runes lit up on the blade, and a green crescent sword projection that was over 1,000 feet in length swept forth before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>"That's a Profound Heavenly Treasure!" Netherworld Monarch Menace immediately exclaimed upon sensing the law fluctuations being released by the giant green sword, and he hurriedly made a hand seal to try and unleash some type of evasive technique, but it was already too late.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted above Netherworld Monarch Menace, and the green crescent reappeared before descending toward him amid a burst of fearsome power of laws.</p><p>The space around him immediately tightened, and his entire body was immobilized by the power of laws, making him feel as if he had been sealed within a massive ice mountain, rendering all struggles completely futile.</p><p>The Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword was far more powerful than Netherworld Monarch Menace had anticipated, and none of the Profound Heavenly Treasure he had seen in the past could compare with its power.</p><p>"I concede! Remove the restrictions!" Netherworld Monarch Menace yelled in a horrified manner, and the two light barriers over encompassing the entire mountain instantly vanished, but the green crescent still continued onward without pause.</p><p>After attempting to use several types of secret techniques to escape, all to no avail, Netherworld Monarch Menace was finally growing desperate. "Power of 1,000 ghosts, explode!"</p><p>All of a sudden, the ghostly faces on his body turned a bright red color before exploding amid a string of resounding booms.</p><p>A cloud of blood mist immediately erupted forth in all directions, greatly nullifying the power of laws in the surrounding area.</p><p>At the same time, Netherworld Monarch Menace's body rapidly shrank down to its original size, and he struggled free from the binding power of laws before rising up into the air.</p><p>Han Li gave a cold harrumph upon seeing this, and he suddenly lashed out like lightning with his giant green sword.</p><p>This was an extremely ordinary-looking slash, but the front half of the giant blade vanished as soon as the attack was unleashed.</p><p>Netherworld Monarch Menace had just evaded the green crescent, but right at this moment, a semi-transparent giant blade projection appeared out of thin air beside him amid a flash of green light, then flashed through the air and sliced his body in half, completely disregarding the protective crimson flames burning over his body.</p><p>Netherworld Monarch Menace let loose an agonized how, but he still didn't panic as he made a hand seal, upon which his lower body instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>His upper body was enveloped within the blood mist, then vanished on the spot amid a resounding boom.</p><p>A hint of mockery appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and he pointed a finger toward that direction, upon which the green crescent also exploded into countless dark green threads that instantly pierced through the space where Netherworld Monarch Menace had just vanished.</p><p>Another anguished cry rang out amid a burst of violent spatial fluctuations, and the top half of Netherworld Monarch Menace's body reappeared.</p><p>However, it was currently riddled with countless holes, resembling a discarded rag.</p><p>Even so, Netherworld Monarch Menace was still alive, and several powerful treasures were released from his severely ravaged body. The treasures quickly converged around him, and he fled toward another direction.</p><p>However, Han Li had already used his Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword, so he naturally wasn't going to allow his opponent to escape.</p><p>After flying for just over 10,000 feet, golden light suddenly flashed in front of Netherworld Monarch Menace, and Han Li appeared in complete silence before thrusting a gigantic golden palm toward his opponent.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out as Netherworld Monarch Menace's defensive treasures and what remained of his body were easily destroyed by the golden palm.</p><p>All of a sudden, two balls of black Qi shot out of his ruined body before fleeing as quickly as they could in different directions.</p><p>Han Li's brows furrowed slightly upon seeing this, and he swept a finger toward one of the balls of black Qi, releasing a streak of azure sword Qi that sliced the creature within the black Qi in half; it was none other than that monkey-like beast.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, countless arcs of golden lightning sprang out of the azure sword Qi, instantly incinerating the beast into ashes.</p><p>Without the support of Netherworld Monarch Menace's magic power, this second soul was unexpectedly fragile and was unable to instantaneously regenerate as it had done before.</p><p>Just as the other ball of black Qi was about to escape, a burst of light flashed on either side of it, and a cow-headed serpentine beast stumbled out of balck Qi amid an anguished wail.</p><p>However, it only managed to rush forward a few more steps before its body completely fell apart, and countless bursts of black Qi erupted forth amid a string of ghostly cries.</p><p>Right at this moment, Jin Tong appeared up above amid a flash of golden light, then raised its hands to release countless streaks of invisible sword Qi that eradicated all of the black Qi within the span of just a few breaths.</p><p>Thus, Netherworld Monarch Menace was well and truly dead.</p><p>......</p><p>At the same time, the lid of one of 10 bluestone coffins situated in an underground hall in another world suddenly exploded, and a shadowy figure abruptly stood up within the coffin as he roared in a furious voice, "Who dared to kill my body? Don't let me run into you. Otherwise, once I forge a new body, I'm going to torture you for all of eternity!"</p><p>The shadowy figure then drifted out of the stone coffin before quickly flying out of the hall.</p><p>......</p><p>Having reverted back to his human form, Han Li was holding a fist-sized red bead in one hand.</p><p>The bead was enshrouded within a layer of black Qi, and its surface was riddled with countless black spots.</p><p>The black spots appeared to be completely unremarkable, but after inspecting them with his spirit eyes, Han Li discovered that these were countless miniature ghostly faces.</p><p>This bead was something that Han Li had secured from the destroyed soul of Netherworld Monarch Menace, and he murmured to himself with a faint smile, "Interesting! This is something that would be worth some careful examination."</p><p>The bead was then stowed away with a flick of his wrist, following which he turned toward the nearby mountains.</p><p>All of the other mountains were currently still enshrouded under light barriers, indicating that his battle was the first one to conclude.</p><p>With that in mind, Han Li cast a meaningful gaze toward the mountain in the middle before flying toward the mountain on his left.</p><p>If he recalled correctly, that was the mountain that Wen Xinfeng had chosen, and with his assistance, she should be able to take care of her opponent in short order.</p><p>After just a few flashes, he appeared above the light barrier, and he made a grabbing motion to summon a miniature black mountain, which quickly swelled drastically in size before being hurled downward.</p><p>At the same time, he made a hand seal to release an azure sword projection that was over 1,000 feet in length, which came crashing down with devastating might.</p><p>Jin Tong also followed suit, unleashing countless streaks of invisible sword Qi that rained down in a torrential storm.</p><p>The two light barriers above the mountain were obviously no match for Han Li and Jin Tong's attacks, and they were quickly shattered to reveal the scene down below.</p><p>As Han Li expected, a fierce battle was still under way on this mountain, and it had been divided into two battlefields.</p><p>On one battlefield, Wen Xinfeng's flying sable had swelled to close to 10,000 feet in size and was clashing ferociously with a two-headed giant lizard of around the same stature.</p><p>The flying sable was flapping its wings incessantly with arcs of silver lightning covering every single inch of its body, while the two-headed lizard was releasing crimson flames out of one mouth, and surging black Qi out of the other.</p><p>Both creatures were extremely resilient, and even as they clashed over and over again, neither side could gain the upper hand.</p><p>As for the other battle that was taking place, it was quite a peculiar one.</p><p>On one side, Wen Xinfeng was seated within a green bamboo forest while making a hand seal with her eyes closed.</p><p>Her entire body was enshrouded within a five-colored robe of light, and there was a white formation plate hovering above her head, from within which countless silver runes were being released.</p><p>Several thousand feet away from her was a massive sea of blood that was over 100 acres in size, within which was an inky-black lotus platform, upon which sat a complete human skeleton.</p><p>The skeleton was completely covered in blood, and there were even some parts of its body where the flesh hadn't completely peeled away.</p><p>However, it was making a hand seal with one hand and carrying a crimson bowl with its other hand just like a normal person.</p><p>Behind the skeleton was a vast expanse of golden light that was around an acre in size with boundless golden flames burning within it.</p><p>Strangely enough, after unleashing their respective secret techniques and treasures to protect itself, the skeleton was also seated in a completely still manner on the black lotus platform, just as Wen Xinfeng was.</p><p>Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this, and he cast his gaze toward a certain area in between the two with blue light flashing within his eyes.</p><p>As a result, that seemingly empty area suddenly transformed into two worlds where the direct opposites, life and destruction, coexisted.</p><p>

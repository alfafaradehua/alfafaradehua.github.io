                                    <h3>Chapter 2291: Battle Against the Asura Spiders (5)</h3><p>All of a sudden, spiritual light flashed from the five longswords, and a burst of law fluctuations erupted, upon which the pair of mountains were sent flying backward.</p><p>In the next instant, the two mountains appeared above Han Li before crashing down with tremendous force.</p><p>Han Li attempted to communicate with the two treasures and instruct them to stop, only to discover that it was as if his spiritual sense connection with them had been severed.</p><p>Han Li's heart jolted upon seeing this, but his expression remained unchanged as he thrust his palms gently toward the pair of extreme mountains.</p><p>In the instant that his palms were thrust upward, silver light flashed from his palms, and around a dozen layers of silver formations were conjured up.</p><p>Two earth-shattering booms rang out, and gusts of fierce winds swept forth in all directions, but Han Li managed to stop the two extreme mountains in the end, following which all of the silver formations vanished amid a flash of silver light.</p><p>In the instant Han Li's hands came into contact with the pair of extreme mountains, the spiritual sense connection was recovered, and he immediately stowed the pair of treasures away.</p><p>At this moment, the brocade-robed man was still maintaining his original posture and hadn't taken advantage of this opportunity to unleash any further attacks.</p><p>Han Li cast his gaze toward him, and said, "I didn't think that you would be able to use the power of the law of time. Having said that, it's quite forced, so you must be relying on something to unleash this power."</p><p>"Hmph, so what if my usage is a little forced? With the power of the law of time on my side, there's no way you can defeat me. The fact that you've managed to identify this power right away tells that you've seen it before elsewhere, is that right?" the brocade-robed man harrumphed coldly.</p><p>He then pointed a finger forward, and the five translucent swords tremored slightly, following which the nearby law fluctuations gradually dissipated.</p><p>A hint of enlightenment appeared in Han Li's as he cast his gaze toward the five swords, and he replied, "I have indeed witnessed the same power elsewhere in the past, and I had thought that only the Asura Spiders would be able to wield this power in this realm. It seems like you must've been in this realm for a very long time and thoroughly earned the trust of these Asura Spiders. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been granted such incredible benefits. However, if you think this will be enough for you to avoid defeat, then you're dead wrong."</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, brilliant purplish-golden light erupted from his body, and he swelled to around 1,000 feet in size in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, he opened his mouth to expel several balls of light of different colors, each of which was releasing a unique yet formidable aura.</p><p>The balls of light contained projections of several types of true spirit beings, and at the same time, layers of purplish-golden scales emerged all over Han Li's body.</p><p>Two additional pairs of arms and a pair of extra heads also emerged beneath his ribs and on his shoulders, respectively.</p><p>He then opened his six eyes, and a short silver horn appeared on each of his three foreheads.</p><p>After witnessing the power of time unleashed by his opponent, Han Li knew that he couldn't hold back any longer and immediately unleashed his Holy Nirvana Physique to its maximal extent.</p><p>In this Third Nirvana Transformation, Han Li's physical body was so fearsome that it would strike horror into the heart of even a Grand Ascension Stage being.</p><p>A smile appeared on his three faces, and he lashed out with his six arms, unleashing countless golden fist projections that hurtled through the air before abruptly vanishing.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted all around the brocade-robed man, and the golden fist projections reappeared before converging toward him in a frenzy.</p><p>The brocade-robed man was very alarmed to see this, and he hurriedly made a rapid string of hand seals, upon which the five translucent swords began to rapidly revolve around him.</p><p>The five swords then transformed into a five-colored light barrier that protected every single inch of his body, while the law fluctuations that had just disappeared were released once again.</p><p>All of the fist projections within a radius of over 100 feet around the brocade-robed man immediately stopped in mid-air, but the rest of the fist projections continued onward and crashed into the immobilized fist projections.</p><p>A resounding explosion erupted outside the five-colored light barrier as one golden fist projection after another was detonated, sending devastating shockwaves surging directly toward the light barrier. However, all of these attacks would be frozen in mid-air as soon as they approached the five-colored light barrier.</p><p>It seemed that an invisible wall had appeared around the light barrier, keeping allo of Han Li's attacks at bay.</p><p>The golden fist projections were imbued with astonishing power, and Han Li seemed to be able to produce an endless supply.</p><p>In a very short span of time, countless explosions had erupted, sending layer upon layer of golden shockwaves surging toward the center, rapidly accumulating a burst of spiritual pressure that struck fear into even the brocade-robed man's heart.</p><p>The brocade-robed man's expression darkened significantly upon seeing this, and right at this moment, the five-colored light barrier began to tremor slightly, while the immobilized golden fist projections in the surrounding area were displaying signs of moving again.</p><p>The brocade-robed man could no longer bide his time, and he immediately switched to a different hand seal, shrinking down the area encompassed by the light barrier by close to half.</p><p>At the same time, he opened his mouth to expel several balls of green blood essence, which transformed into a series of blue runes that vanished into the light barrier in a flash.</p><p>The trembling light barrier was instantly stabilized, while the golden fist projections and shockwaves were immobilized once again.</p><p>A hint of relief appeared in the brocade-robed man's eyes upon seeing this, but he still immediately began to chant an incantation.</p><p>Faint runes began to appear on the light barrier, and it seemed that the five swords were about to be reformed.</p><p>However, right at this moment, Han Li suddenly stopped what he was doing before flipping a hand over to produce a green longsword amid a flash of green light.</p><p>The longsword had several indecipherable ancient silver runes inscribed on its surface, and as soon as it was summoned, all of the world's origin Qi in a radius of several kilometers injected itself into the sword in a frenzy as streaks of dazzling light.</p><p>As a result of this influx of power, the green longsword quickly swelled to around 1,000 feet in size, following which it was slashed through the air without any hesitation.</p><p>The silver runes flashed, and a giant silver crescent moon was unleashed by the sword, sweeping through the countless fist projections in a flash before directly plunging into the space encompassed by the power of law of time.</p><p>The silver crescent moon was able to completely disregard the power of laws in that area and struck the five-colored light barrier like lightning, much to the horror of the brocade-robed man.</p><p>A resounding boom rang out, and the crescent moon tremored slightly before disintegrating into specks of silver light.</p><p>Another burst of even more potent power of laws swept forth, tearing through the law of time imbued within the light barrier before exploding into a ball of silver light.</p><p>The two bursts of powers of laws clashed, and the ball of silver light rapidly expanded like a rolling snowball, reaching several acres in size in the blink of an eye.</p><p>All types of violent energy fluctuations surged through the surrounding area, sweeping up fearsome tornadoes that encompassed the entire sky.</p><p>After unleashing that slash, Han Li's mountainous ape body shrank down to less than half its original size, but his aura didn't wane in the slightest.</p><p>A fierce look appeared in his eyes as he gripped onto the giant green sword with all six of his hands, then roared as he slashed the weapon through the air again.</p><p>On this occasion, a streak of green sword Qi was unleashed by the green sword as opposed to a silver crescent moon.</p><p>In the instant the sword Qi was unleashed, it appeared directly above the ball of silver light, then transformed into a massive ring-shaped blade.</p><p>The ring-shaped blade was of an exuberant green color and was around half a kilometer in size with peerlessly sharp edges.</p><p>Furthermore, it was giving off powerful law fluctuations.</p><p>Black light flashed from Han Li's three glabellas, and three inky-black demonic eyes emerged.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, he pointed a finger on each hand into the distance, and uttered the word, "slash".</p><p>Silver runes appeared on the surface of the ring-shaped blade, following which it abruptly vanished into thin air.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted near the ball of silver light, and the ring-shaped blade re-emerged right around the ball of light.</p><p>The ring-shaped blade then abruptly contracted, disappearing as a projection.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, a green line appeared around the ball of silver light amid a resounding boom, and the entire ball of light was sliced cleanly in half by the ring-shaped blade.</p><p>

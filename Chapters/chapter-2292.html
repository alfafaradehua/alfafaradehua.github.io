                                    <h3>Chapter 2292: Battle Against the Asura Spiders (6)</h3><p>In addition to the ball of silver light, even the nearby space had been severed by the green line, creating a massive black rift.</p><p>After all of the silver light faded, the green line was revealed once again, and the space either side of the green line had turned completely black and white.</p><p>The section above the green line remained unchanged, but that was only because it was being shielded by a five-colored light barrier.</p><p>In contrast, there was an inky-black spatial rift beneath the green line, and the spatial power emanating from the rift was spreading in all directions in a frenzy, as if it were going to devour the entire area.</p><p>Everyone couldn't help but pause upon seeing this before sweeping their spiritual sense toward this direction.</p><p>After ascertaining the situation, the Asura Spiders were very alarmed, while Mo Jianli and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>The brocade-robed man hadn't been killed by the attack, but his lower body was already nowhere to be seen, and there was sweat pouring down his forehead as he held a five-colored shield, which had conjured up the light barrier that had saved his upper body.</p><p>The light barrier was formed by the five-colored runes surging out of the shield, and it was keeping the black spatial down below at bay.</p><p>"That's a complete Profound Heavenly Treasure! Without the power of laws of that treasure, there's no way you would've been able to break through my law of time!" the brocade-robed man roared with a panicked expression.</p><p>Even for Grand Ascension Stage beings, Profound Heavenly Treasures were extremely rare, and the majority of Grand Ascension Stage beings never came into possession of a Profound Heavenly Treasure; it was already considered to be very good if they could obtain one or two Profound Heavenly Treasure replicas.</p><p>The brocade-robed man was quite outstanding among normal Grand Ascension Stage beings, but he wasn't fortunate enough to have come across a Profound Heavenly Treasure.</p><p>However, the fact that he had managed to survive two slashes from the Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword was already an indication of his incredible power.</p><p>"You're one to talk; you wouldn't be able to use you power of time either if not for those five swords," Han Li chuckled coldly as he took a step forward.</p><p>After unleashing that second slash, he had shrunk down even further to only just over 100 feet tall.</p><p>A dull thump rang out as the nearby space tremored, and Han Li covered a distance of over 1,000 feet in an instant, arriving directly above the brocade-robed man.</p><p>The world's origin Qi surged violently, and he unleashed a third strike with his green longsword without any hesitation.</p><p>A silver sword projection descended from above like a bright moon, bringing a burst of powerful law fluctuations along with it.</p><p>The brocade-robed man's face paled significantly upon seeing this. Never did he think that his opponent would have the power to unleash three attacks with his Profound Heavenly Treasure in such a short span of time.</p><p>Unleashing an attack with a Profound Heavenly Treasure was unimaginably taxing on both the wielder's energy and physical body.</p><p>If a Grand Ascension Stage being with a weaker physical body were to unleash a full-power attack with such a treasure, their body could disintegrate on the spot.</p><p>This was why Han Li had only been able to unleash a portion of the Profound Heavenly Spiritslash Sword's power back at the Body Integration Stage, even in his Second Nirvana Transformation.</p><p>Of course, the brocade-robed man wasn't just going to resign himself to his fate. </p><p>A fierce look flashed through his eyes, and he pointed a finger at the shield before him, then opened his mouth to expel several balls of green blood essence into the shield. At the same time, he hurriedly yelled, "Fellow Daoist Luo, call upon Fellow Daoist Ying right away; I won't be able to last much longer!"</p><p>His words were directed toward the green-robed woman.</p><p>At this moment, she was caught in an intense battle against Xue Ran and Hei Lin, wielding hundreds of thin azure needles that had transformed into countless streaks of dazzling light.</p><p>She had been constantly monitoring the entire battlefield with her spiritual sense, and upon hearing this desperate cry, she gritted her teeth before quickly making a decision. She produced a red wooden badge within her sleeve, then immediately crushed it into powder with her hand.</p><p>Elsewhere, Mo Jianli was already several tens of kilometers away, simultaneously retreating while battling against the four mature Asura Spiders with the help of his two spirit beasts and seven or eight different treasures.</p><p>Judging from the strained look on his face, it was clear that he wouldn't be able to last much longer.</p><p>All of a sudden, a shadowy figure in the most secure secret chamber beneath the stone city suddenly opened her bright, crimson eyes.</p><p>She was holding a translucent stick in her hands, and outside the secret chamber were placed roughly a dozen crimson balls, each of which had a diameter of around 10 feet.</p><p>A crisp crack sounded, and white light flashed from the surfaces of the crimson balls through a series of white cracks.</p><p>Bursts of formidable auras then emanated out of the cracks, as if there were some time of monsters about to emerge from the crimson balls.</p><p>......</p><p>The translucent shield flashed and transformed into five swords again before being slashed through the air, releasing faint law fluctuations that only just barely managed to keep the silver crescent moon at bay.</p><p>At the same time, the five-colored light barrier down below vanished, while a pair of five-colored wings appeared on the brocade-robed man's back, which he flapped vigorously without any hesitation.</p><p>As a result, he was propelled directly toward the stone city.</p><p>A cold light flashed through Han Li's eyes, and the green longsword in his grasp suddenly tremored slightly, upon which the spiritual pressure emanating from the silver crescent moon abruptly increased by severalfold, allowing it to tear through the feeble opposing law fluctuations with ease.</p><p>The five swords wailed, and four of them exploded into specks of spiritual light, while one went completely dim and plummeted out of the sky, vanishing into the sand down below.</p><p>A bolt of silver lightning flashed in front of the brocade-robed man, and Han Li appeared right in his way to the stone city.</p><p>At this moment, he had already withdrawn his green longsword, as well as the demonic eyes and short horns on his heads. At the same time, he had deactivated his Holy Nirvana Physique and was only in his normal Provenance Golden Body form.</p><p>Han Li remained completely expressionless as he thrust his six massive fists toward the brocade-robed man, and six balls of golden light were summoned before converging to form a golden vortex, which swept directly toward his opponent.</p><p>A horrified look flashed through the brocade-robed man's eyes upon seeing this, and he gritted his teeth as one of his five-colored wings swept past his shoulder to sever one of his arms, which immediately self-detonated.</p><p>The arm then transformed into a crimson humanoid figure that flew into the vortex, upon which it was instantly pulverized amid a rumbling explosion, but the golden vortex was also stopped in its tracks for a moment as a result.</p><p>Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this as the brocade-robed man had vanished in the instant that the crimson figure had charged toward the golden vortex.</p><p>He immediately turned around to find that the brocade-robed man had reappeared on the giant city wall, which was enshrouded under several layers of light barriers.</p><p>At this point, his phoenix head had already reverted back to his normal human head.</p><p>A hint of surprise flashed through Han Li's face. The secret technique unleashed by the brocade-robed man was very similar to the tribulation transcendence technique Han Li had cultivated in the past. Even if they weren't the same secret technique, they were definitely related somehow.</p><p>The brocade-robed man was clearly in very bad condition, and after aiming a vicious glare at Han Li, he hurriedly pulled out a few pills that he immediately consumed, then summoned several talismans that disappeared into his body in a flash.</p><p>He then began to chant an incantation, and clouds of blood mist wafted out of his wounds as his body began to rapidly regenerate.</p><p>Countless crimson threads intertwined with one another, and his arm and lower body were already beginning to take shape; it seemed that he would be able to completely recover soon.</p><p>Of course, Han Li wasn't going to afford him such an opportunity. He flipped three of his hands over in unison, and three miniature mountains immediately surfaced over his palm, all of which he hurled toward the stone city without any hesitation.</p><p>At the same time, he made a grabbing motion with his other three arms, and three azure longswords emerged before swelling to around 10 feet in size each, following which they were also slashed toward the stone city.</p><p>Countless azure sword projection swept forth, while the three small mountains expanded to several thousand feet in size before crashing down toward the stone city at once.</p><p>The light barriers outside the stone city flashed erratically, and restriction fluctuations erupted forth in a frenzy.</p><p>At the same time, a group of Asura Spiders and other high-grade beasts that were seated on a formation in a secretive corner of the city threw up mouthfuls of blood in unison while their faces paled significantly.</p><p>The restrictions around outside the city were quite formidable, but there was no way they'd be able to last long against such ferocious attacks.</p><p>Thus, the light barriers were quickly stripped away, and in the blink of an eye, there was only one left.</p><p>The brocade-robed man's face completely paled upon seeing this.</p><p>Never did he think that Han Li would still have enough power to break through the restrictions around the city after such a fierce battle.</p><p>Right at this moment, a seductive voice rang out from within the stone city.</p><p>"What's going on, Mother? I've only been in seclusion for several years, yet we're already being attacked?"</p><p>

                                    <p>His facial features twisted and warped before transforming into those of a young man who appeared to be around 16 to 17 years of age.</p><p>His pupils had also turned bright red, and he was giving off an overwhelming scent of blood and gore. The young man removed his hands from his head before slowly standing up straight again. </p><p>He looked around at the human and devilish beings down below with a peculiar expression, then appraised his own hands before suddenly bursting into raucous laughter. "I've finally arrived in the Spirit Realm! So that really was a viable method, after all. Haha, I'm probably the first Sacred Ancestor to have accomplished this; it really is a wonderful feeling..."</p><p>All of the high-grade human cultivators were very alarmed to hear this, while the high-grade devilish beings were ecstatic upon getting a clear glimpse of the young man's appearance.</p><p>One of the high-grade devilish beings immediately half-knelt onto the ground, and greeted, "We pay our respects to our Sacred Ancestor! Congratulations on descending into the Spirit Realm, Sacred Ancestor!"</p><p>His greeting seemed to have acted as a reminder to the other devilish beings, and the entire devilish army immediately knelt down in unison.</p><p>As for the human army, all of their faces instantly paled as they looked up with horror and despair in their eyes.</p><p>The devilish lords were still rather bewildered, seemingly more hesitant than elated.</p><p>Master Azure Dragon's expression changed drastically before a cold look appeared on his face, and he yelled, "No need to fear! This devil was only able to descend into this world after possessing a host, so he most likely doesn't possess even a tenth of the powers of his true body; we can still win this battle! Fairy Lin, get the Aura Integration Beast to kill this devil while we hold off the other devilish lords."</p><p>Fairy Lin Luan was rather hesitant, but after taking a glance at all of the human cultivators standing on the city wall, she gritted her teeth and nodded as she abruptly thrust a finger toward the crimson talisman on her own glabella.</p><p>The Aura Integration Beast suddenly let loose a thunderous roar at her behest, then expelled a gust of fierce yellow wind out of its cavernous mouth. The devilish beings around it were all blown aside, and it flapped its wings vigorously, forcibly tearing its way out of the devilish army as it flew toward the young man.</p><p>Even though the young man hadn't displayed any of his powers yet, the aura that he was giving off struck the beast with a sense of danger. As such, even without Fairy Lin Luan's instructions, it was still inclined to kill this young man in case he posed a threat to it later on.</p><p>Meanwhile, Master Azure Dragon let loose a loud roar, and the seven short blades re-emerged over his body as he transformed into a giant azure dragon once again. Howling winds and bolts of lighting erupted around him, and in the face of his ferocious barrage of attacks, the devilish army around him was unable to pursue the Aura Integration Beast.</p><p>Tie Long was unleashing countless hammer projections with his pair of giant hammers, and the attacks seemed to be extremely powerful, but he was rather distracted as he was focusing most of his attention on the Aura Integration Beast and the young man.</p><p>Han Li was naturally extremely alarmed by this turn of events as well. Even though this wasn't the actual true body of Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang, it didn't seem to be an ordinary spiritual sense clone, either. </p><p>The aura that the young man was giving off was truly formidable, and far superior to that of the average late-Body Integration cultivator.</p><p>Now that the Aura Integration Beast had been unleashed on the young man, Han Li also stopped what he was doing to appraise the situation.</p><p>Fei Ya was naturally quite relieved to see this, and he hurriedly consumed a few antidote pills, then began to circulate his magic power to force the poison out of his body.</p><p>If someone below the Body Integration Stage had been infected by the poison of the Revolving Evil Spirit Light, they would've already been killed, and he was only able to last this long as he was able to forcibly repress the poison with his mid-Body Integration Stage powers.</p><p>The young man faltered slightly at the sight of the Aura Integration Beast before murmuring to himself in a surprised manner, "To think there's an Aura Integration Beast present; no wonder all of you still haven't won this battle yet. I just so happen to require a steed; I guess you'll suffice."</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, the young man flipped a hand over, and a small purple cauldron appeared over his palm amid a flash of purple light.</p><p>The young man laid a hand onto the cauldron, and uttered the word "net"!</p><p>The cauldron immediately began to revolve on the spot, and an ancient rune emerged from within it amid a flash of black light, then shot forth directly toward the Aura Integration Beast.</p><p>The Aura Integration Beast opened its mouth to expel a gust of ferocious yellow winds upon seeing this, and at the same time, its wings transformed into a yellow cloud that completely concealed its entire body.</p><p>The giant beast then hurtled directly toward the black rune without any pause, and it was quite clear that it was very confident in its own defensive abilities.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's face upon seeing this, and he also made no effort to take evasive measures.</p><p>After just a few flashes, the black runes flew directly into the yellow cloud and vanished without a trace. In the next instant, a thunderous roar of shock and horror rang out, and the giant beast was completely immobilized in mid-air.</p><p>There were countless black threads that had bound its body, and these threads were extremely thin, but the beast was unable to break free from them no matter how much it thrashed and struggled.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on the Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's face upon seeing this, and he suddenly turned toward Han Li.</p><p>Han Li immediately shuddered as a chill ran down his spine, and Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang remained completely expressionless, but he suddenly waved a hand toward Han Li. At the same time, he uttered the word "come".</p><p>A burst of rumbling rang out as the giant rainbow pagoda nearby abruptly rose up into the air, then vanished into thin air in a flash.</p><p>In the next instant, bright rainbow light erupted over Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang's palm, and a miniature pagoda appeared above his hand before being tossed toward the Aura Integration Beast.</p><p>He then made a hand seal, and the pagoda transformed into a burst of rainbow light that instantly inundated the giant beast.</p><p>When the rainbow light reverted back to its pagoda form, the Aura Integration Beast was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Almost at the exact same moment, Fairy Lin Luan exclaimed in a panicked voice, "My talisman can no longer sense the Aura Integration Beast!"</p><p>Han Li's heart immediately sank upon hearing this.</p><p>As the true owner of the purple cauldron and the rainbow pagoda, the two treasures were significantly more powerful when being wielded by Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang.</p><p>Han Li wasn't confident at all that he would be able to escape from the pagoda again if he were to be sealed into it for a second time.</p><p>Master Azure Dragon was also very alarmed to see this, and he immediately yelled, "Go!"</p><p>Bright spiritual light then erupted from his azure dragon body, and he forced his way through a series of hammer projections that were unleashed by Tie Long before flying directly back to Heavenlean City.</p><p>He had immediately chosen to flee the scene now that the outcome of this battle was virtually nothing more than a foregone conclusion.</p><p>Fairy Silver Light and Fairy Lin Luan exchanged a fearful glance, then also fled toward two different directions.</p><p>As for Han Li, he swept both sleeves through the air to withdraw his Azure Coil Sword Formation, then also flapped his Thunderstorm Wings and fled the scene as an arc of lightning.</p><p>"It's too late for you to try and get away now!" Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang guffawed.</p><p>He immediately made a series of hand seals, and crimson Qi emerged from his body before forming two figures that were identical to himself.</p><p>One of them was holding the rainbow pagoda while the other was holding the small purple cauldron, and they both chuckled coldly before vanishing on the spot in a flash.</p><p>As for the final member of the trio, he stomped a foot, and crimson Qi swirled beneath him before forming a small crimson canoe.</p><p>The canoe was only 70 to 80 feet in length, but it was glittering and translucent, and there were countless profound rainbow runes inscribed on its surface.</p><p>The canoe shot forth and quickly disappeared into space with the young man standing atop it.</p><p>When the canoe re-emerged amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, it had already covered a distance of several thousand feet, and it seemed that it would catch up to Han Li after just two more flashes.</p><p>Han Li had detected this with his spiritual sense, and he was given quite a fright.</p><p>In this dire situation, he gritted his teeth and transformed into a giant four-winged silver bird amid a rumbling thunderclap.</p><p>He flapped his four wings vigorously and transformed into a silver thread that flashed through the air at an astonishing speed.</p><p>"Hmm? That's a Kun Peng transformation technique! Hehe, do you think that'll be enough to allow you to escape from me? Go and take care of those Body Integration Stage human cultivators; I'll go after that man myself," Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang chuckled coldly as he issued an instruction to Tie Long and the other devilish lords.</p><p>Immediately thereafter, his two clones also emerged beside him as if they had never left, and they both made a hand seal in unison.</p><p>Two pairs of crimson crystalline wings instantly emerged on the sides of the small canoe, and the canoe shot forth as a crimson thread with a vigorous flap of those wings.</p><p>

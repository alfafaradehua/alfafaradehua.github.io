                                    <h3>Chapter 2094: Profound Heavenly Black Dagger</h3><p>Both the Long Family patriarch's golden dragon and the suit of armor being worn by the woman from the Ye Family were able to completely disregard the pressure exerted upon them by the giant devilish hand, clearly indicating that they were far more powerful than ordinary treasures and abilities.</p><p>The golden dragon raised its massive head, and a thick pillar of golden light erupted out of its mouth before striking the giant devilish hand in a flash.</p><p>After unleashing that attack, the golden dragon dissipated as if it had exhausted all of its power.</p><p>Meanwhile, five-colored light surged over the suit of armor being worn by the woman from the Ye Family, and a giant sword projection that was over 100 feet in length appeared above her head, which also shot forth to strike the giant devilish hand.</p><p>The massive devilish hand tremored violently in the face of these attacks, and the enormous pressure being released by it abated significantly.</p><p>Even though its power was only nullified for a split second, the Long Family patriarch and the woman from the Ye Family were both seasoned Body Integration Stage beings, so they naturally weren't going to miss this opportunity.</p><p>Bright golden light erupted from the former's body, and he expanded drastically in size, transforming into his half-dragon form again before slamming his golden-scaled arms viciously onto the ground.</p><p>The earth tremored violently amid a resounding boom, and a burst of shockwaves erupted outward with the Long Family patriarch at the epicenter.</p><p>Using the force of these shockwaves to his advantage, the Long Family patriarch was finally able to break out of the giant devilish hand's restriction.</p><p>He immediately shot up from the ground like a speeding arrow, then appeared several hundred feet away.</p><p>He didn't immediately try to escape as he knew that would only lead to a faster demise in the face of this Sacred Ancestor.</p><p>As such, he took a deep breath before sweeping his sleeves through the air, releasing seven or eight treasures of different descriptions that began to revolve around his body.</p><p>Among them were a small jade seal that was several inches in size and a fist-sized golden bracelet. As soon as these two treasures appeared, the nearby world's origin Qi instantly became extremely active; this was a pair of Profound Heavenly Treasure replicas!</p><p>It seemed that the Long Family patriarch was bringing out his true trump cards in a bid to save his own life.</p><p>At the same time, dazzling light swirled over the armor being worn by the woman from the Ye Family, and the light surged toward her back in a frenzy before manifesting into a pair of giant wings that were several tens of feet in length.</p><p>Not only were these wings covered in countless five-colored feathers, there was a ball of flames at the tip of each of the wings that were constantly changing color.</p><p>She flapped her wings gently, and the two balls of flames exploded to set the entire space around her alight.</p><p>Dazzling light immediately erupted from her giant wings, and they instantly transformed into a pair of spectacular wings of fire!</p><p>The woman from the Ye Family then let loose a delicate cry as she flapped her fiery wings vigorously, upon which violent spatial fluctuations erupted around her.</p><p>The nearby space began to warp and collapse, and a white hole with a diameter of around 100 feet appeared around her.</p><p>In the next instant, her body blurred, and she vanished into the hole in a flash.</p><p>As opposed to being enraged upon seeing this, the black-robed young man's eye lit up with intrigue instead. "Impressive! I was wondering what gave you the courage to venture so deep into our holy realm; I see now that you've inherited some true spirit bloodlines. True dragon and heavenly phoenix, eh? Tsk tsk, those two are the most renowned ones among all true spirit beings. Looks like I'll be adding your true spirit blood to my collection."</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, the black dagger hovering near him suddenly flashed twice in succession again.</p><p>The Long Family patriarch's expression changed drastically as he frantically shot back in retreat. At the same time, the treasures he had summoned released bursts of dazzling light that enveloped his entire body.</p><p>A tearing sound suddenly rang out, and the light around him caved in significantly, then tremored violently amid a string of resounding booms as if it had been struck by a burst of invisible power.</p><p>The treasures within the light flashed erratically a few times before exploding into balls of spiritual light, and only the jade seal and golden bracelet were still just barely holding on.</p><p>The Long Family patriarch's expression changed drastically as he quickly made a hand seal, then opened his mouth to expel two bursts of white Qi, which vanished into the remaining two treasures in a flash.</p><p>The light emanating from the treasures abruptly swelled, and they were fortified by this injection of power.</p><p>Meanwhile, a black thread disappeared into the white hole in a flash, following which the hole was sliced apart down the center.</p><p>Almost at the exact same moment, a delicate cry of alarm rang out over 100 feet away, following which a burst of fearsome energy fluctuations erupted forth.</p><p>The black thread that had just vanished suddenly flew out of thin air, immediately following which a huge ball of five-colored flames also emerged.</p><p>Within the ball of flames was a petite figure with a pair of huge fiery wings; it was none other than the woman from the Ye Family.</p><p>She was currently staring at the black-robed young man with horror in her eyes, and one of her arms had gone missing.</p><p>Not only had the black thread broken her spatial secret technique, it had almost sliced her body in half as well.</p><p>if it weren't for her split-second decision to sacrifice her own arm, she would've followed the same fate as Holy Maiden Thousand Autumns.</p><p>The woman from the Ye Family quickly cast her gaze toward the Long Family patriarch to find that even though his expression appeared to be quite calm, the horror in his eyes was very apparent.</p><p>The woman from the Ye Family was plunged into despair upon seeing this.</p><p>The black-robed young man was rather surprised to see that his attacks had failed to achieve the desired effect, a derisive sneer than appeared on his face as he raised a hand to grab onto that black dagger.</p><p>The woman from the Ye Family and the Long Family patriarch's expressions immediately darkened significantly upon seeing this.</p><p>It was clear that the next attack unleashed by this Sacred Ancestor wasn't going to be as nonchalant as the previous one, so there was a very slim chance that they'd be able to survive it.</p><p>Just as the two of them were looking on in dread and horror, the black-robed young man suddenly raised the dagger, and a row of ancient silver text appeared on its surface.</p><p>The dagger then tremored slightly before a pillar of black light erupted out of its tip before vanishing straight into the heavens in a flash.</p><p>In the next instant, howling winds were suddenly swept up, and a huge black hole appeared up in the sky.</p><p>Bursts of inky-black devilish Qi surged out of the black hole alongside gusts of bone-chilling Yin winds, following which the black Qi transformed into over 100 huge black runes.</p><p>The black-robed young man then immediately pointed a finger upward, and the black runes all descended from the heavens like shooting stars before vanishing into the black dagger.</p><p>After absorbing the black runes, the silver runes on the surface of the dagger lit up, and the dagger itself swelled to become a giant black sword that was around 10 feet in length in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The black-robed young man cast a cold gaze toward the Long Family patriarch and the woman from the Ye Family before uttering the word "slash"!</p><p>The giant sword was swept through the air, and a crescent streak of black light that was over 100 feet in length surged through the air.</p><p>The Long Family patriarch and the woman from the Ye Family immediately prepared to fight for their lives, but they were both stumped when they saw the direction that the black light was traveling toward.</p><p>Instead of heading toward them, black light abruptly changed directions and swept toward the ball of black devilish flames which had swept up Han Li earlier.</p><p>After the devilish flames had engulfed Han Li, it had continued to burn without showing any signs of abating, but the black-robed young man had suddenly decided to attack it for some reason.</p><p>"Do you really think a mere aura concealment technique will fool me? Looks like you're the most powerful one among all of the intruders, so I'll send you on your way first!"</p><p>As soon as his voice trailed off, the black crescent warped, then transformed into a series of thin and long black threads.</p><p>There were over 10,000 of these threads, then scattered before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted all around the black devilish flames, and the black threads emerged before intertwining to form a massive black net that shrank at a rapid rate.</p><p>"Seal!"</p><p>Han Li's voice suddenly rang out from within the devilish flames, immediately following which a ball of purple light erupted forth before transforming into a massive "seal" character that exploded on the spot.</p><p>A burst of peculiar energy fluctuations swept through the surrounding air, and the devilish flames instantly faltered along with the rapidly shrinking black net. However, everything then instantly returned to normal, but during that split-second delay, an azure and white thread of light had flown through an opening in the black net amid a loud thunderclap.</p><p>The thread of light then appeared between the Long Family patriarch and the woman from the Ye Family in a flash, revealing itself to be Han Li with golden lightning revolving around his body and the Thunderstorm Wings on his back.</p><p>

<h1>chapter-2083</h1>

<p>After the mist dispersed, Han Li was nowhere to be seen.

The woman from the Ye Family hurriedly swept her spiritual sense through the surrounding area, but was shocked to discover that she could no longer sense Han Li.

All of a sudden, Han Li's calm voice rang out in her ears. "There's no need to be alarmed, Fellow Daoist. Those Azure Wing beings are about to get here, so we have to make haste." Her heart stirred upon hearing this, and she immediately replicated what Han Li had just done.

Purple light flashed, a cloud of silver mist dispersed to conceal her entire body.

The High Zenith Invisibility Talisman naturally had completely different levels of efficacy when used by different people.

As a Body Integration cultivator using this talisman, she wouldn't be discovered unless a devilish lord of the same cultivation base in the Azure Wing Race were to carefully search for her using their spiritual sense.

As for Han Li, after using the High Zenith Invisibility Talisman, only the top devilish lords who were half a step away from becoming Sacred Ancestors would have a chance of discovering him.

At this point, the giant flying snake was already slowly descending toward the mist down below, and it stopped briefly in mid-air as the elderly inspected the surrounding area, then made a hand seal to release a streak of green light that vanished into the mist in a flash.

Moments later, the aroma being released by the mist became several times more pronounced, and the mist parted to open up a path that was around 10 feet wide.

At the other end of the path, one could just barely make out a series of indistinct buildings, and the elderly devilish man immediately stomped a foot down onto the flying snake without any hesitation upon seeing this.

The flying snake hissed as its body rapidly shrank down amid a flash of azure light, following which it was stowed up the elderly man's sleeve.

The elderly man then turned to the younger devilish beings behind him and said something with a smile, then drifted into the opening in the mist.

The young devilish beings also followed along behind him with wide smiles on their faces.

The mist then surged as the path was slowly sealed.

Unbeknownst to the devilish beings guarding the restriction, two completely undetectable figures had tailed these young devilish beings into the opening in the mist.

Around two hours later, Han Li was hovering in the air above a black wooden pagoda that was over 1,000 feet tall. He was still concealed by his High Zenith Invisibility Talisman, and he was inspecting the massive village down below.

This village had an area of over 10,000 acres, and massive trees were growing between the three mountains, forming a natural barricade around the entire village.

These giant trees were all purple in color, and they were the source of the fragrant aroma stemming from this place.

Within the village were a series of wooden buildings of different sizes that could house over 100,000 devilish beings.

Considering the meager population of the Azure Wing Race, this was a very large settlement.

There were also some giant trees planted between the buildings in the village, concealing many of the smaller buildings, thereby creating a sense of privacy.

Blue light flashed within Han Li's eyes as he swept his gaze over the entire village, then settled his attention on a cluster of buildings that were releasing restriction fluctuations.

Some Azure Wing Race guards were patrolling the streets near these buildings, and none of the ordinary Azure Wing beings dared to approach them.

The blue light in Han Li's eyes faded as he drifted down from the wooden pagoda, then landed in an alley that was completely devoid of people. 

After that, an Azure Wing being that had a set of facial features that were identical to Han Li's emerged in a soundless manner.

This type of disguise secret technique couldn't even begin to compare with the concealment effect of his High Zenith Invisibility Talisman, but it was enough to fool the average devilish being.

Han Li smiled as he strode out of the alley, then made his way toward the heavily-guarded cluster of buildings.

At the same time, the woman from the Ye Family had already revealed herself as a young female devilish being elsewhere in the city before making her way toward a secluded corner.

She was holding a crimson triangular metal badge in her hand, and there were faint energy fluctuations emanating from it.

...... 

In a small wooden cabin in the village, a five-colored light barrier had been set up, and there were two humanoid figures seated across from each other in the room; these were none other than Han Li and the woman from the Ye Family, who had scouted the village for the past two days.

Han Li asked in a solemn manner, "So you've already confirmed that there are core Azure Wing beings residing in that palace?"

"That's right, my detection treasure is displaying a very strong reaction, so it seems that there are many core Azure Wing beings living there, which is both good news and bad news," the woman from the Ye Family sighed.

"Do you think this will make things more difficult for us, Fairy Ye?" Han Li asked.

"With so many core Azure Wing beings gathered in one place, that palace must be very heavily guarded; perhaps there will even be more than one devilish lord on guard duty there, so our original plan isn't going to be very feasible. On top of that, we don't have much time left," the woman from the Ye Family replied in a concerned manner.

"In that case, we'll just have to do things by force. I'll hold off the devilish lords there while you take care of the core disciples; will that be alright?" Han Li asked.

"Without any intervention from devilish lords, it naturally won't be an issue for me to capture a core disciple. However, once we strike, we'll have to make sure to get away in a short time. Otherwise, other high-grade devilish beings will arrive on the scene. Judging from the scale of this village, there are probably at least seven or eight devilish lords here, and that isn't even taking all those Spatial Tempering Stage devilish beings into account. On top of that, breaking through the restrictions set up around the village will also take some time," the woman from the Ye Family cautioned.

"Leave the restrictions to me. I know a thing or two about formations, and during the past two days, I've discovered a few weak points in the restrictions here," Han Li said in a confident manner.

The woman from the Ye Family was ecstatic to hear this, and she said, "In that case, we should be all set. As long as we can make a quick getaway, those devilish lords shouldn't be able to chase us down. The only thing we have to be wary of is that we still don't know where that Sacred Ancestor clone is residing."

"It would naturally be best if we don't encounter the clone. Otherwise, we'll have to use that treasure to temporarily trap him," Han Li said.

"That would be the worst-case scenario. Let's set this matter aside for now and get some rest; we'll strike tonight so no other volatile factors arise," the woman from the Ye Family proposed.

"Alright, we'll do as you say." Han Li had no objections to this, and he immediately closed his eyes to meditate.

The woman from the Ye Family carefully reviewed the plan again, and after confirming that it was indeed sound, she also slowly closed her eyes.

Around half a day later, there was a devilish man seated on a bed of ice in a large palace in the Incense Village. The man had a head of exuberant black hair, which belied his wrinkly facial features, and he was currently cultivating a certain secret technique.

It was impossible to ascertain his age from his appearance, but the spiritual pressure emanating from his body clearly indicated that he was a powerful devilish lord.

Around 10 feet away from the bed of ice was a small stone platform that resembled an altar. It was only several feet tall, but there were countless runes inscribed on its surface, indicating that it was no ordinary structure.

All of a sudden, a ball of black light erupted out of the altar alongside a low buzzing sound.

The devilish man immediately opened his eyes in a startled manner and cast his gaze toward the altar.

"What's going on? Did those little rascals trigger the restriction again?" the devilish man murmured to himself with furrowed brows, then immediately made a hand seal and vanished from the room amid a fierce gust of wind.

In the next instant, a gust of wind was swept up in the main hall of the palace, and the man re-emerged.

He cast his gaze around the hall, and his pupils immediately contracted slightly.

In a corner of the hall was an azure-robed humanoid figure, who was currently inspecting a giant black blade hanging on the wall.

The black blade was only a decorative item crafted from ordinary materials, but the azure-robed figure seemed to be very intrigued by it.

The devilish man was quite alarmed, but he remained completely expressionless as he asked in a cold voice, "Who are you, and why have you broken into our palace this late in the night?"

"I was just bored and wanted to find someone to have a chat with," the azure-robed figure replied as he continued to appraise the huge black blade.

"You wanted someone to chat with? Are you..." All of a sudden, the devilish man's voice was cut off as a dull thump rang out from the neighboring room, causing the entire hall to tremor violently.

The devilish man's expression changed drastically, and he immediately darted toward a certain exit of the palace, leaving a trail of afterimages in his wake.

However, right at this moment, the azure-robed man chuckled as countless arcs of azure and white lightning appeared over his body, upon which he abruptly disappeared.

In the next instant, lightning flashed in front of the devilish man, and the azure-robed figure appeared before flicking his fingers through the air, sending countless azure threads hurtling forth from his fingertips, forming a powerful azure sword net.

<h1>chapter-773</h1>

<p>With an expressionless face, Han Li raised his hand, releasing a blue light from his sleeve. In the blink of an eye, it expanded to become a huge shield and received the strike from the huge brick. Bang! Yellow and blue light intertwined as the brick and the shield remained at a standstill. 

When Han Li saw the shield fall back towards him, he calmly pointed at it, and in a flash of blue light, it came to a sudden stopped. Then, the huge brick circled around the shield and smashed towards Han Li. 

Han Li coldly smiled and disappeared once more in a flash of silver light. The yellow-robed old man was alarmed by this and raised his hand without another thought, summoning a small purple flag into his hand. It quickly transformed into a purple cloud that surrounded his body. 

In that same moment, the old man heard thunder coming from his left. As soon as Han Li appeared, he opened his mouth and spat a small sword towards the purple cloud. An instant later, a layer of deep blue flame emerged from within it. 

When the old man saw the blue flames on top of the sword, he lost his composure and wore a faceful of terror. His body instantly blurred three meters away in an attempt to dodge the sword. 

But against his complete expectations, a woman suddenly appeared behind him as if she had already anticipated where he would dodge. She raised her hand and released an azure ball that struck at the spell warrior like a bolt of lightning. 

The woman appeared without a trace, like a ghost. It was as if Han Li coordinated with this woman to perform a precise and incisive strike. 

Even with such skilled execution, the old man was able to see this coming through his spiritual sense. But at such a short distance, he was unable to dodge; his only choice was to surge the entirety of his magic power into the purple cloud covering his body. He was somewhat confident in the treasure that formed from the transformed purple cloud. 

A huge explosion sounded out as golden and azure light brilliant flashed. The purple cloud had crumpled in the exchange and the old man within was in a pathetic shape. Half of his body was gone, and the remaining half was engulfed in azure flames. 

Overwhelmed with disbelief and furious alarm, resentment appeared on the old man’s face as he gritted his teeth. With a boom, body combusted and a blinding streak of yellow light flew through the skies, revealing an inch-large Nascent Soul with the exact same face as the old man. 

Seeing the circumstances were far from good, he decisively anticipated to abandon his body and flew out as a Nascent Soul in a vain attempt to flee. 

However, Han Li had already anticipated this. Just as the old man’s Nascent Soul attempted to escape, he disappeared in a flash of silver light and blocked the Nascent Soul’s escape path. He waved his hand, summoning a golden net from his hand in a clang of thunder. In that same moment, a small sword covered in blue flames shot out from his sleeve as well. 

The Nascent Soul wore a face of terror upon the sight of Han Li, and spat out an inch-large bowl in its panic. The sparkling silver bowl charged forward to meet the oncoming golden net, and before they made contact, the old man’s Nascent Soul caused it to rupture with a spell seal. In a burst of silver light, countless fragments shot at the lightning net, faintly shaking it upon impact. 

In that short moment of delay, the Nascent Soul employed an instantaneous movement technique. In a flash of yellow light, the Nascent Soul disappeared without a trace, only to appear a hundred meters away. It then disappeared from sight in a brilliant streak of yellow light. 

The golden net was a step too late and allowed the prey to escape. Han Li frowned and glanced in the direction the Nascent Soul had escaped, possessing no intention of chasing it. 

“Such a wise and decisive character is rarely seen. In order to save his life, he actually destroyed his own personal magic treasure.” A white-clothed woman suddenly appeared, holding the old man’s storage pouch in her hand. 

Han Li gloomily snorted. “A mere stroke of luck!” With both the Thunderstorm Wings and the Celestial Ice Flames, the Moulan spell warrior was as good as him. It seemed killing an off-guard high-grade spell warrior was harder than he thought. 

Han Li glanced at Silvermoon and said, “Regardless, it seems your movement technique is much more powerful than before. You are even able to conceal yourself a close distance away.”

Silvermoon smiled. “The Four Pupiled Fox is truly adept as concealment techniques. With my recent advancements, I’ll be able to easily attack them, given that Master is occupying their attention.” 

“Good!” Han Li indifferently nodded. Although Silvermoon was only his tool spirit, she was also the only other person who knew of the secret of his small bottle. But at an unknown time, he faintly felt a veil of mystery shroud her. 

After a few more words with Silvermoon, Han Li turned his head to examine the battlefield. After further examining it, Han Li was able to see through the chaos. 

At the greatest heights of the sky, there were six late Nascent Soul cultivators battling. Excluding them, there were three sections of the battle. One was the small-scale skirmishes; cultivators and spell warriors would head out in various sized groups spanning from several tens to even a thousand, and would fight at each other in close quarters. 

These cultivators and spell warriors were very adept at fighting in their groups. As a result, they were much stronger together than alone. Both sides found it difficult to eliminate one another, and they were stuck at a standstill. 

Additionally, they were battles were a few individuals fought against a crowd of enemies. These cultivators and spell warriors possessed superior cultivation. These battles were far more dangerous than the group battles; a single mistake could lead to death in both body and soul. 

Finally, there were those wielding unfathomable techniques and treasures as they stood in confrontation. 

The most eye-catching of them was a large black mist floating in the air, releasing sharp wails. Any spell warrior that was captured by the mist immediately fell from the sky as a corpse. Whenever it appears, the nearby spell warriors would always fearfully keep their distance. 

And behind the ghost mist, there would be several fearless spell warriors that continuously struck at the mist with wind and lightning attribute spell techniques and magic treasures. Each strike seemed to scatter a small portion of the mist. However, there were still people continuously waving their flag magic tools within the mist and summoning more mist. This left the Moulan spell warriors without a good plan to deal with it. 

In another area, there were a dozen Nascent Soul grade cultivators that were currently engaged in a battle against a three-hundred-meter tall stone giant. It appeared to be made of ordinary stone, but not only was its figure large, but a few small stones would rain down every time it moved its body. 

These cultivators didn’t dare to receive the giant’s attack even under the protection of the spell formations. Additionally, there were several spell warriors standing on top of its head and shoulders. They were assisting the giant with their own magic treasures. 

There were also a few cultivators and spell warriors that were engaged in a battle using magnificent treasures, each possessing power far beyond ordinary ancient treasures. These sect and tribe protecting treasures have greatly opened Han Li’s horizons. 

Although Han Li emerged from the blood barrier, he remained idle as he observed the nearby fights due to the chaos. He was about a kilometer away from the nearest battles, but even so, two Moulan Sages emerged from the fray and flew towards Han Li with overbearing momentum. 

Seeing Han Li ruthlessly dispatch of a similarly ranked spell warrior in an instant, the two had no certainty of victory. However, they couldn’t allow this Nascent Soul cultivator to reign free, or the damage he will cause will be far too great. 

“Come!” Han Li coldly ordered Silvermoon. He then flew towards a neighboring blood barrier. 

When Silvermoon saw this, she wore a strange smile as she chased after him. 

An azure streak of light appeared above the blood-red barrier, and was soon struck by a lightning bead. Afterwards, Han Li disappeared once more in front of another blood barrier. Han Li planned free these other Nascent Soul cultivators before planning what to do. 

A huge explosion sounded out, along with a streak of scarlet light flying out from the gap in the blood barrier. With a series of laughter, the freed man said, “I, Shattered Soul, cannot thank you enough for your assistance.” The scarlet light disappeared to reveal a grey-robed cultivator. 

‘Daoist Shattered Soul?’ Han Li was slightly surprised to see that this was the first person he rescued. 

“Fellow Daoist, block those two for me while I rescue the others.” With a quick thought, Han Li immediately gave him a voice transmission. 

“Yi! So it turned out to be Fellow Daoist Han. Your kindness cannot be thanked with words. Please allow me to deal with them!” The grey-robed cultivator revealed shock upon seeing Han Li, but he soon agreed. In a streak of white light, he flew over to face the two Moulan sages. 

When Han Li saw this with his spiritual sense, he inwardly smiled and quickly flew over to another blood barrier. With a wave of his hand, another azure light was released. 

But at that moment, something unexpected had occurred. The top of the blood barrier flashed with grey light, revealing a large embroidered-robed man. He looked at the incoming lightning bead with a solemn expression. 

Han Li was shocked. How was this person able to conceal himself there without even the slightest trace. When Han Li swept his spiritual sense past this person, he couldn’t help but reveal his alarm.

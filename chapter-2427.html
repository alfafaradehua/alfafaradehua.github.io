<h1>chapter-2427</h1>

<p>Thus, several of the most renowned powerful beings on the entire Tian Yuan Continent perished before they could utter even a single sound.

As for Ming Zun and the others, they managed to survive under the protection of the Great Silver Heavenly Tome.

Countless crimson threads struck the light barrier formed by the treasure, causing it to flash erratically before dimming significantly, but it remained resolute.

However, Yin Gangzi had the others had all turned extremely pale, and Ming Zun immediately cast his gaze toward the Mythical Black Beasts with a dark expression.

As a result, they discovered that the four black-armored young man were hiding behind a black fire barrier and had also survived that attack.

Ma Liang was rather surprised to see that so many people had survived that attack, but a cold look then immediately appeared on his face as he made a hand seal before pointing a finger at the giant crimson seal from afar.

A burst of loud rumbling out as the giant seal continued to descend, easily pulverizing the light pagoda beneath it, which was already riddled with holes.

Thus, the seal came crashing down toward Ming Zun and the others, and the nearby space was enshrouded by that burst of fearsome power again, while the nauseating odor of blood and gore also reappeared.

"What do we do, Brother Ming?" Yin Gangzi yelled.

"What else can we do aside from fight for our lives? Rest assured, fellow daoists; he must've expended a vast amount of true essence to unleash that attack, so there's no way he'll be able to use it a second time. Fellow Daoist Wu Ling, Brother Yin, do your best to oppose this treasure for now, and I'll unleash a secret technique to try and seal him in his current depleted state. Fellow daoists, please unleash an all-out attack with your bonded true flames to assist me," Ming Zun communicated through voice transmission to the other Grand Ascension Stage beings, as well as the four Mythical Black Beasts.

"How confident are you that you'll be able to seal him, Brother Ming?" Mistress Wu Ling asked in a slightly hesitant manner.

The deaths of the other Grand Ascension Stage beings had already struck fear deep into her heart.

"I'm unleashing an immortal secret technique that requires me to sacrifice a part of my soul and severely deplete my essential power, so there's at least a 50% chance that it'll succeed," Ming Zun replied.

Mistress Wu Ling knew that there was no way she could successfully escape on her own, so she could only grit her teeth before replying, "Alright, then I'll trust you one more time. Fellow Daoist Yin, let's strike together."

Yin Gangzi nodded in response before immediately letting loose a thunderous roar, upon which his body swelled drastically once again, and thick silver patterns appeared all over his skin. His arms also thickened significantly, and he clenched his hands into tight fists before lashing out with devastating might.

As for Mistress Wu Ling, she brought the pair of giant yellow swords in her hands together, and the two combined into one to form a yellow mace that she swung gently through the air, unleashing a gust of yellow wind.

The woman in the palatial dress hadn't said anything this entire time, but after witnessing Yin Gangzi and Mistress Wu Lingâ€™s attacks, she immediately pulled a jade hairpin with three blue beads embedded onto it out of her hair before tossing it up into the sky.

The jade hairpin exploded into a ball of spiritual light, while the three blue beads flew higher up into the air, then transformed into three head-sized balls of blue light that were completely unremarkable in appearance.

A cold smile appeared on Ma Liang's face upon seeing this, and the blood mist around the crimson seal surged at his behest before a series of thick crimson feelers emerged.

These feelers then transformed into crimson spears that rained down from above like a lethal storm.

The crimson spears were immediately met by the countless fist projections unleashed by Yin Gangzi and the yellow wind released by Mistress Wu Ling's mace, upon which all of the oncoming spears were destroyed or sent flying.

Meanwhile, the three balls of light seemed to possess no substantial form as it continued to rise upward, and all of the crimson spears that struck it merely passed through it without being able to impact it in any way.

In the next instant, the flurry of silver fist projections and the yellow mace struck the giant seal with tremendous force, and yellow, silver, and crimson light intertwined amid a resounding boom.

However, the giant seal only tremored slightly, but was still steadily descending.

Yin Gangzi and Mistress Wu Ling's expressions changed drastically upon seeing this, and the former stomped a foot onto the space beneath him before slowly thrusting his hands upward in a pushing motion, while the latter hurled her yellow mace through the air while chanting an incantation.

Several earth-shattering booms rang out in rapid succession, and two massive silver hands appeared beneath the giant seal to oppose it from below.

At the same time, a gargantuan yellow mace that resembled a divine weapon also rose up into the sky before striking the underside of the seal with unstoppable might.

The mountainous seal shuddered slightly in the face of these attacks, and it finally drew to a halt in mid-air.

However, the pair of giant silver hands and the massive mace immediately began to tremor violently, as if they wouldn't be able to last much longer.

Yin Gangzi and Mistress Wu Ling's expressions both darkened upon seeing this.

At this point, both of them were pouring all of their magic power into the silver hands and yellow mace, and they didn't have any power to spare to resist the seal's descent any further.

Right at this moment, the three balls of blue light finally arrived near the seal, and they exploded as soon as they came into contact with the blood mist.

A burst of glacial power that could virtually freeze one's soul immediately spread through the air, following which three giant blue ice flowers with diameters in excess of 100 feet emerged from within the glacial Qi, then released three pillars of translucent light that struck the seal from below.

A layer of dark blue glacial ice immediately took shape on the underside of the seal, and the ice was spreading at an incredible rate, encompassing most of the seal within the span of just a few breaths.

Not only were Yin Gangzi and Mistress Wu Ling stunned to see this, even Ming Zun was looking on with an astonished expression.

"Oh? Those are seeds of Night-blooming Ice Flowers! I didn't think there would be seeds of such an exotic flower here in a lower realm. Having said that, this is not going to be enough to trap my Myriad Spirit Blood Seal," Ma Liang said with a hint of surprise on his face before suddenly blowing toward the seal from afar.

Specks of golden flames immediately appeared around the seal, then pounced onto the blue glacial ice, and a string of loud cracks and pops immediately rang out.

At the same time, the giant itself also began to release a layer of crimson flames.

Thus, the blue ice was sandwiched between two types of flames, and it was rapidly melting away.

The woman in the palatial dress had already sat down and was injecting her magic power into the three ice flowers up above with all her might. "Brother Ming, what are you waiting for? I can't keep this up for long!"

"Rest assured, fellow daoists, I've already made my move," Ming Zun replied in a calm manner.

Yin Gangzi and the others naturally faltered slightly upon hearing this.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted above Ma Liang, and a miniature azure figure that was roughly a foot tall appeared.

The figure's facial features were completely concealed behind a layer of azure light, but it was holding a rusty black lamp

Ma Liang immediately raised his head and released a burst of golden flames out of his mouth, which instantly swelled to become a sea of fire that swept toward the miniature figure. 

The space in the wake of the golden flames twisted and warped violently, as if it were about to be melted.

However, the miniature azure figure merely raised the lamp it was holding in an unhurried manner before swinging it toward the sea of flames down below.

Faint black light flashed over the surface of the lamp, and a series of grey runes drifted out before, upon which the golden flames surged into the lamp in a frenzy.

In the blink of an eye, the entire sea of golden flames had been drawn into the lamp, and even Ma Liang couldn't help but falter slightly upon seeing this.

Right at this moment, the miniature figure tossed the lamp downward, then transformed into a ball of azure light that sprang into the lamp to ignite the charred black wick within it.

Thus, a small grey flame immediately appeared within the lamp, and at the same time, Ming Zun's face paled slightly as his body slumped forward involuntarily.

A burst of buzzing rang out from the lamp, and a layer of grey flames flashed over its surface, upon which it swelled to countless times its original size, encompassing virtually the entire sky.

In the instant that Ma Liang was enveloped by the silver flames, his immortal spiritual power abruptly congealed. On top of that, the protective golden light around him faded, and he was unable to unleash any further secret techniques.

Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted around him, and the four Mythical Black Beasts emerged in unison before opening their mouths to release black fireballs the size of wagon wheels, all of which crashed directly toward Ma Liang at once.

Ma Liang was quite alarmed by this turn of events, but he immediately clenched his hands up into tight fists before lashing out toward the four black fireballs.

Three resounding booms rang out as three of the fireballs were instantly destroyed by Ma Liang's fists, but the final one suddenly warped before transforming into a black shadow that reached Ma Liang in a flash before revealing itself to be a grey-robed man.

The grey-robed man raised a hand and laid his palm onto Ma Liang's waist, then said in a bone-chilling voice, "Nine Tribulation Spirit Vanquishing Arts!"

<h1>chapter-2169</h1>

<p>A speck of golden light suddenly appeared on Daoist Xie's fingertip, then instantly transformed into a golden ball of light with a diameter of around 10 feet.

The black ax projection struck the ball of light in a completely soundless manner, but in the next instant, the ball of light flashed violently a few times before self-detonating, unleashing bursts of golden shockwaves that swept toward the ax projection in retaliation.

Golden and black light intertwined, and the black ax projection was unable to advance any further.

A look of surprise appeared on the golden-armored man's face while a series of balls of golden light erupted out of thin air around Han Li, then shot forth in all directions as countless thin sword projections.

Spatial fluctuations erupted within these sword projections, and a pair of humanoid figures were forced to reveal themselves.

One of them had gusts of fierce winds revolving around his body to sweep away the oncoming sword projections, while the other was surrounded by arcs of lightning that eradicated all of the nearby sword projections with ease.

These two were none other than the green-robed elderly man and the three-eyed armored man.

The two of them were clearly very surprised to have been forced out of thin air, and they immediately turned toward Han Li with vicious expressions.

The two devilish women were also quite taken aback by this, and the two exchanged a surprised glance.

"Hmph, you've got some backbone! Do you really think the two of you can contend with all five of us? Have you deluded yourselves into thinking that you're both Grand Ascension Stage beings? Do you have a death wish?" the green-robed elderly man harrumphed coldly.

"I'm no Grand Ascension cultivator, but you're not true Sacred Ancestors, either, so what do I have to fear?" Han Li replied with a calm smile.

"What a big mouth you have! Fellow daoists, it looks like we'll have to take care of him before we can continue onward. Let's kill him together, then continue on our way," the elderly man said as a cold light flashed through his eyes.

Even though he didn't know why Han Li was so confident, a hint of peril had suddenly welled up in his heart, and he knew that he couldn't treat Han Li lightly.

"Don't stick your noses into this battle! These two are my opponents; do you really think I can't take care of a pair of Body Integration Stage beings?" the golden-armored man roared with a furious expression.

His four companions were just about to spring into action, but they couldn't help but falter slightly upon hearing this.

"Brother Niu, have you forgotten the orders we received? The outcome of this battle hinges on our success; this is no time for you to be throwing a fit! If we lose this battle because of you, then you'll have to answer to our masters," the elderly man threatened in a cold voice as his expression darkened slightly.

The golden-armored man shuddered upon hearing this before quickly forcing a smile onto his own face. "Ah.. ahaha, forgive me for getting so worked up, Brother She; I'm well aware of how important mission is. In that case, let's strike together; these two seem to have some tricks up their sleeves, so it would be best to kill them as quickly as possible."

Han Li was left feeling rather speechless at the sight of how quickly the golden-armored man's attitude had shifted, but the elderly man was completely unsurprised to see this. Instead, he issued an instruction in a completely expressionless manner, and the five devilish beings instantly surrounded Han Li's duo.

The five of them appeared to be moving slowly, but all of them had prepared vast amounts of magic power, and were no longer hiding their fearsome auras.

"So they really are all Sacred Ancestor clones. Brother Xie, how many of them can you take on?" Han Li asked as his eyes narrowed slightly.

"I can kill two or trap three," Daoist Xie replied nonchalantly, as if he were merely talking about the weather.

"Alright, then I'll leave three of them to you and take on the remaining two," Han Li replied without any hesitation.

"No problem," Daoist Xie replied.

"Hehe, you two sure dare to talk big! Take this!" The golden-armored man was furious upon hearing what was being said, and a mountainous cow head projection instantly appeared behind him amid a flash of black light, following which he hoisted his massive black ax before swinging it viciously toward Han Li again.

This attack was different from the previous one in that on this occasion, thousands of ax projections were unleashed, all of which had black devilish Qi revolving around them and were directed straight toward Han Li's duo.

The golden-armored man's actions seemed to have ignited the killing intent in the hearts of the other devilish beings, and they all attacked at once.

A fierce look appeared on the elderly man's face as he swept his sleeves through the air, releasing two swarms of bright red poisonous hornets, each of which was around the size of a finger.

These hornets were all giving off a pungent rank odor, and they flew rapidly toward Han Li and Daoist Xie as soon as they were released.

Meanwhile, the three-eyed devilish being made a hand seal, and the third eye on his glabella sprang open, revealing red, yellow, and green light swirling within his pupils before three dazzling pillars of light were unleashed.

The pillars of light reached Daoist Xie in a soundless manner in a flash, and at the same time, the petite devilish woman rubbed her hands together before raising them in unison, releasing countless pink threads of light that converged to form a massive pink net before descending from above.

Accompanying the net was a faint fragrance, and upon inhaling this scent, even Han Li was feeling rather light-headed, which was rather alarming to him.

As for the final winged devilish woman, she flapped her wings gently, and specks of black light appeared behind her amid a burst of glacial Qi.

The woman harrumphed coldly as the specks of black light shot forth, transforming into black ice spikes mid-flight, taking up almost half of the entire sky with their massive numbers.

In the face of this string of attacks, a loud thunderclap erupted behind Han Li, and a pair of translucent wings appeared on his back amid a flash of lightning.

He then let loose a low cry as he abruptly flapped his wings, and he instantly vanished on the spot amid a loud thunderclap.

Thus, Daoist Xie was the only one left at the center of all of the attacks, but he merely disregarded the oncoming barrage as he took a step forward.

Golden light flashed from his body, following which a dense golden light barrier appeared around him, and the light barrier was immediately inundated by the pillars of light, ax projections, ice spikes, and the pink net of threads.

Resounding booms rang out relentlessly as dazzling lights intertwined, and the surrounding space warped violently as astonishing shockwaves swept forth in all directions.

The two swarms of red hornets didn't dare to approach the epicenter of the clashes and could only unleash streaks of crimson light from afar, further contributing to the assault.

However, the golden light barrier seemed to be an impregnable fortress, and it didn't waver in the slightest in the face of the ferocious attacks raining down upon it.

Meanwhile, Daoist Xie stood completely still within the golden light barrier, adopting a passive stance without displaying any intention of retaliating.

The five devilish beings were stunned to see this, and their expressions darkened significantly.

Right at this moment, an arc of silver light flashed up above alongside a burst of spatial fluctuations, and Han Li emerged amid a loud thunderclap.

He cast his gaze down below, and a cold smile appeared on his face as he made a hand seal to summon his Provenance True Devil Projection again.

As soon as the giant projection appeared, it thrust its six palms downward in unison, and a ball of golden light comprised of countless golden runes appeared in the palm of each of its hands.

A cold look appeared on the winged devilish woman's face upon seeing this, and she flapped her wings viciously upward in unison.

Two streaks of that were over 100 feet in length instantly appeared before sweeping up toward Han Li, and at the same time, the elderly man raised a thin and wizened palm upward.

The palm extended out of his sleeve with purple light flashing incessantly around it, and a massive purple claw projection that was around an acre in size instantly appeared beneath Han Li before grabbing toward him with ferocious might.

These Sacred Ancestor clones were truly far more powerful than normal devilish lords, and devastating attacks were directed toward Han Li as soon as he emerged from his lightning teleportation.

The other three devilish lords hadn't attacked him, but that wasn't because they hadn't detected his presence; they were merely of the opinion that the elderly man and winged woman would be enough to take care of Han Li.

Han Li was quite elated to see this, and he immediately injected his spiritual power into his Provenance True Devil Projection in a frenzy.

Brilliant golden light immediately erupted from the projection, and the balls of light in its hands swelled drastically in size before being hurled downward in unison.

<h1>chapter-2295</h1>

<p>The shield glowed with scintillating light as it attempted to keep the fist at bay, but it was shattered in an instant amid a burst of piercing purple light.

The protective spiritual light around the brocade-robed man was also punctured with ease, and Han Li's fist struck his body with devastating force.

The brocade-robed man hurriedly injected all of his power into his suit of silver armor without any reservation, and the crimson patterns on the suit of armor surged forth as countless runes, forming a crimson light barrier around him.

A hint of mockery flashed through Han Li's eyes upon seeing this, and he spread open the fingers on his hand, upon which all of the layers of silver formations on his hand exploded in unison as a burst of silver light.

As for Han Li himself, he had suddenly vanished on the spot.

The brocade-robed man faltered slightly upon seeing this, then directed his spiritual sense toward that burst of silver light, upon which his face completely paled with horror.

The top of his head immediately opened up, and a miniature figure that was only around a foot tall instantly fled out of his body.

Right at this moment, the burst of silver light struck the crimson barrier, and a devastating explosion instantly erupted.

A dazzling silver sun emerged at the spot where the brocade-robed man was standing before, and its surface was riddled with countless silver runes that formed a series of formations of different sizes.

In the next instant, all of the formations on the surface of the silver sun exploded as well, and a massive pillar of light erupted forth, while destructive silver shockwaves proliferated outward in all directions; it was as if doomsday had truly arrived.

Such an astonishing phenomenon naturally drew the attention of everyone else on the battlefield, and all of them stopped what they were doing before fleeing into the distance in fear of being swept up in the explosion.

Xue Ran and Hei Lin were ecstatic to see this, but at the same time, a hint of astonishment had appeared in their eyes.

Both of them were more powerful than the average Grand Ascension Stage being, but there was no way that they would be able to unleash such a fearsome attack.

It seemed that Han Li's powers had far exceeded their expectations.

As for the green-robed woman, a hint of fear welled up in her heart for the very first time at the sight of the pillar of light in the distance.

Xue Ran and Hei Lin exchanged a quick glance, then immediately resumed their assault against the green-robed woman.

As such, she was forced back into battle, transforming into a horrifying three-headed spider that charged toward Xue Ran and Hei Lin.

Thus, their battle quickly resumed.

As for Mo Jianli and the four mature Asura Spiders, they were nowhere to be seen, having moved elsewhere during the course of their battle.

After a long while, the massive pillar of light faded, as did the silver shockwaves.

Aside from the residual scorching aura in the air, everything had returned to normal.

However, the brocade-robed man was nowhere to be found, and it seemed that he had perished during the explosion.

A cold look flashed through Ying'er's eyes upon seeing this.

Right at this moment, spatial fluctuations erupted around 5,000 to 6,000 feet away, and a miniature figure that was flashing with five-colored light appeared.

The miniature figure wore a suit of five-colored armor and was holding a small azure seal in its hands. This was none other than the brocade-robed man's Nascent Soul.

The Nascent Soul cast a resentful glance toward Han Li, then immediately fled toward the stone city as a streak of five-colored light.

However, a golden figure with three heads and six arms suddenly appeared in its way amid a flash of spiritual light.

The Nascent Soul immediately changed directions to skirt around the golden figure, but as it did so, a pair of furry golden hands suddenly appeared out of thin air.

A giant golden ape that was over 100 feet tall then emerged before opening its mouth to release a thick bolt of golden lightning.

It was too late for the Nascent Soul to take evasive measures, so it could only toss its azure seal forward, which swelled drastically in size to shield him.

The golden lightning struck the azure seal viciously, sending it flying backward, but the lightning was also snuffed out.

A hint of killing intent flashed through the golden ape's eyes, and it stepped forward before reaching out with a giant hand like lightning.

However, during this split-second of delay, the Nascent Soul had already made a hand seal, upon which it vanished on the spot as a flurry of five-colored feathers.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted over 1,000 feet behind the giant ape, and the Nascent Soul reappeared before continuing to flee toward the stone city.

Right as it was about to enter the light barrier around the city, a cold harrumph suddenly rang out, and the Nascent Soul felt as if its spiritual sense had been struck by a bolt of lightning, causing it to almost plummet out of the sky.

At the same time, specks of yellow light appeared all around it, transforming into grains of yellow sand.

A yellow sandstorm was quickly swept up, trapping the Nascent Soul within it while a burst of enormous invisible force compressed toward it in a frenzy.

A string of cracks and pops rang out from the Nascent Soul's body, and an agonized look appeared on its face, as if it were about to be crushed by the force being exerted upon it.

Furthermore, the force was only becoming more and more potent.

Meanwhile, the golden ape remained still on the spot, but the top of its head had opened up, and a miniature azure-robed figure had emerged, holding a tiny gourd with one hand.

Wisps of yellow light were surging out of the gourd's opening, but all of it quickly vanished into thin air.

With each wisp of yellow light that disappeared, the force being exerted upon the Nascent Soul would be compounded slightly.

Han Li had predicted the Nascent Soul's escape route, and he had immediately released his own Nascent Soul before summoning the gourd treasure he had obtained not long ago to release the Baleful Golden Astral Sand.

The brocade-robed man's Nascent Soul was stopped cold in its tracks by Han Li's spiritual sense attack, and it was now in dire straits inside the yellow sandstorm.

In this desperate situation, Ying'er finally sprang into action again.

Four of the wolf-headed beasts around her exploded without any warning, following which four clouds of crimson mist emerged within the yellow sandstorm amid a burst of spatial fluctuations, then shielded the brocade-robed man's Nascent Soul within them.

The pressure on the Nascent Soul was instantly alleviated, and it was ecstatic as it transformed into a miniature Five-colored Peacock that was radiating scintillating five-colored light.

Han Li's Nascent Soul narrowed its eyes slightly upon seeing this, and all of a sudden, countless translucent runes appeared on the surface of the yellow gourd at his behest.

The sandstorm raging around the brocade-robed man's Nascent Soul immediately began significantly more fierce, and fist-sized grains of sand that were giving off peculiar restriction fluctuations began to appear.

At the same time, spatial fluctuations erupted above the sandstorm, and Han Li's Provenance Golden Body abruptly emerged.

As soon as the golden body appeared, it summoned a golden weapon in each hand, comprised of a saber, a sword, a staff, a ring, a pestle, and a mace, all of which were swung downward with vicious force.

The sandstorm was instantly torn apart, and a ball of golden light erupted forth sweeping up all types of chaotic energy fluctuations that spread through the air in all directions.

Han Li's Nascent Soul peered into a pair of inky black eyes at the center of the light, upon which its pupils contracted slightly. It then prepared itself to make a hand seal, but a thought suddenly seemed to have occurred to it, and it suddenly stopped what it was doing. 

Spatial fluctuations suddenly erupted beside Ying'er on the city wall, and a miniature peacock that was missing one of its wings emerged before immediately wailing, "Save me, Fellow Daoist Ying! Only your Spirit Reversal ability can repair my Nascent Soul; I'll be sure to reward you handsomely for this." 

As soon as its voice trailed off, the miniature peacock returned to its human form, but close to half its body had gone missing, and its aura was extremely feeble, as if it could perish at any moment.

Even though it had managed to escape with the assistance of Ying'er, it had still been severely damaged by the Baleful Golden Astral Sand and the six weapons of the Provenance Golden Body.

If Ying'er didn't save it with her power of time, it could even plummet to below the Grand Ascension Stage, which was why it was so desperate.

Ying'er glanced at the Nascent Soul before giving a slight nod, then extended a palm toward it.

<h1>chapter-671</h1>

<p>Silvermoon cried out in astonishment, "The Sacred Asura Flames! Of course I remember. Those are the devilflame known as the sacred flames of the Ghost Dao. If the Bone Sage had truly refined them, there would've been few in this world that could be his match. However, the flames you've used don't seem very similar to what the Bone Sage displayed during that day."

"Of course not. These aren't the Sacred Asura Flames. But while I don't know the specifics behind this particular flame, its might is clearly superior to the Celestial Ice Flames. If I haven't guessed incorrectly, once the flames are fused with the six-winged frost centipedes' icy Qi, their might will increase to the point where they could rival the Sacred Asura Flames. This was something I had unintentionally discovered after I absorbed the centipede's icy Qi. A fortunate coincidence indeed."

Once that was said, Han Li twirled his finger and had the bird disappear into his hand.

Silvermoon was initially stunned, but soon she revealed delight. With a salute and a gorgeous smile, she said, "This servant congratulates Master. The Celestial Ice Flames were something that common Nascent Soul cultivators didn't dare to touch. With these newly fused devilflames, Master would be able to dominate the entirety of the Heavenly South." 

Han Li shook his head and sullenly said, "Dominate the Heavenly South? Those words are too bold. I do not know how many late Nascent Soul cultivators are in the Heavenly South, but each of these eccentrics should possess many years of vast experience and have their own killing moves. Perhaps one of them might have something to restrain my devilflames."

Silvermoon pursed her lips and revealed a careless expression, "Master is being too modest. How could such an opportune matter occur in this world?"

Han Li smiled and said, "It's hard to be sure. The Gold Devouring Beetles may be incisive and are highly ranked, but the Bloodjade Spiders happen to be able to restrain them despite their vastly lower rank. If I were to run into a cultivator that knows about these beetles and possesses jade or wooden treasures, it would prove vastly disadvantageous for the beetles. There will also be something that can restrain these devilflames. In this entire world, there is no such thing as a treasure or technique that is unrivaled." 

"Master is still quite a careful and cautious person. From what you're saying, you must want to prepare several killing moves to prevent yourself from being restrained by others."

As if not yet finished speaking, Han Li unhurriedly continued, "I've previously never accepted disciples because my cultivation was lacking and I was a wanderer, with my residence ever changing. It would've been burdensome to take a disciple. But now that I am firmly established at the Drifting Cloud Sect, it is natural to nurture a few sources of influence of my own. Although one's own strength is extremely important in the cultivation world, it is more dangerous and inconvenient to stand alone. 

"At the very least, useful information will make its way to me. For example, there was no one who had taken the initiative to inform me of the trade meet that would take place in the State of Yu in two years. Although those two elders would notify me at the last second, I wouldn't be able to make any preparations. As for Liu Yu, while her cultivation isn't very high, she doesn't seem to be someone that is only able to diligently cultivate. After entering the Drifting Cloud Sect, I reckon she would strive her hardest to develop her own influence without my orders."

Silvermoon smiled and added on, "With the soul restriction placed on her, she will be unable to betray you until her cultivation surpasses Master's. Her influence will therefore naturally be your own. This is far more advantageous than accepting an ordinary disciple."

Han Li glanced at Silvermoon and indifferently said, "It's good that you know!"

He then turned his gaze towards the Iron Rhino. The spirit beast had managed to unsteadily raise itself, but its aggressiveness was vastly reduced. It now gazed at Han Li with a trace of fear.

"Although this spirit beast isn't very useful for me, I am able to directly control it through the use of a magic tool since it belonged to a clan. I will be able to trade it for very good materials. After you train it, shut it in the spirit beast room. Once the trade meet in the State of Yu takes place, I'll see whether or not I can exchange it for a few rare materials. I'll be leaving now to place a soul restriction on Liu Yu." Han Li took a black command talisman from his storage pouch and handed it over to Silvermoon.

Silvermoon took it into her hands and respectfully replied, "As you command, Master!"

Han Li then stood up and wordlessly left the room.

Silvermoon fiddled with the command talisman in her hand and muttered to herself with a pensive expression as if pondering about what Han Li just said. A moment later, she raised the command medallion towards the light barrier with a smile. A beam of yellow light then shot out.

Soon after, a series of miserable bellows filled the hall.

...

After Han Li placed the soul restriction onto Liu Yu, he brought her to the silver-haired old man. Of course, he didn't give the complete truth. He merely mentioned that they had a bit of relationship and he had brought her back to the State of Xi from the Controlling Spirit Sect, intending to take her in as a disciple and look after her.

When the old man heard this, he was initially stunned before laughing with an expression of realization.

"I was wondering why Junior Martial Brother Han made a trip to the Devil Dao's domain. So it turned out to be for Martial Niece Liu. Good, very good! This sect could always use another Core Formation cultivator, and a woman at that!" The silver-haired old man accepted Liu Yu into the Drifting Cloud Sect without a problem.

Han Li was very satisfied by this and chatted with the old man a while more before departing with the woman. Liu Yu then officially changed her name to Liu Mei and officially became Han Li's in name disciple.

Although Han Li said he wouldn't personally guide the woman, he wasn't about to be stingy when taking a disciple underneath him. He gave the woman two magic treasures and several bottles of demon core refined medicine pills.

If Liu Mei had been reluctant about taking Han Li as a master, she was now more than happy to pay her respects to him after such magnanimous gifts. For the first time, she felt that leaving the Controlling Spirit Sect to become Han Li's disciple wasn't such a bad thing.

Fortunately, this woman was rather quick-witted and soon handed over a jade slip containing all of the insect controlling techniques that she knew of. She also handed over her six-winged frost centipedes. Han Li accepted these items with a calm expression and concluded the disciple acceptance ceremony. 

After departing Han Li's cave residence, she established her own cave residence at the Drifting Cloud Sect's White Phoenix Mountain and became a member of the Drifting Cloud Sect's high grade cultivators.

Unclear as to whether or not the silver-haired old man was paying face to Han Li, Liu Mei was appointed as deputy mountain lord of White Phoenix Mountain, giving Mountain Lord Song an assistant. When Han Li heard of the matter, he merely smiled.

After Han Li acquired the centipedes, he used the Rainbow Skirt Grass to mature them. Given that they had this effect towards the Gold Devouring Beetles, they should also affect the six-winged frost centipedes as well. Of course, he also entered a secluded room and began to study the insect control techniques alongside the Profound Nascent Formation Arts that Xin Ruyin had left behind.

Han Li sat motionlessly on the floor with his eyes shut as an azure light began to flow around his body as if he were cultivating a technique. A long while later, he opened his eyes and his eyes brightened. He promptly grabbed onto the storage pouch at his waist and wordlessly pointed, uttering, "Execute!"

Suddenly, several thousands of black-tainted Gold Devouring Beetles flocked from the pouch and hastily turned into a three meter large cloud that spiralled above Han Li.

Han Li stood up without any hesitation and began to move his feet in a pattern as he muttered to himself. He raised his hands and shot a mist of azure light, enveloping the beetle cloud. The Gold Devouring Beetles suddenly stopped buzzing and began to hover back and forth in tight formation. However, none of them made contact with one another, making for a bizarre sight.

Han Li's gaze brightly flickered as he watched the beetle cloud. He stared for a time before forming an incantation gesture with a single hand. He then extended his free hand as if reaching for the beetles and softly shouted.

Azure light flickered from the beetle cloud and they immediately fell onto Han Li, enveloping him within them. The beetles were several times quicker than before and began to frantically fly circles around him, forming an impenetrable barrier.

Han Li smiled at the sight, but that smile soon disappeared as he began to utter profound and cryptic incantations. Suddenly, the insect cloud suddenly charged towards Han Li with a sudden eruption of blinding azure light.

A short moment later, the light disappeared to reveal Han Li's body covered in armor with simple designs of gold, silver, and black. The armor sparkled with azure light and continuously glinted. From a glance, one could tell it was incredibly hard and durable.

Han Li's smile became a grin and he stroked the armor. It felt unfathomably smooth as if it were without flaw.

Han Li's smile faded away and he sighed, muttering, "Not bad! I truly didn't think that my idea from Heavenvoid Hall of using beetles as armor would work. The Controlling Spirit Sect are truly worthy of their fame for their insect control techniques. They are far more powerful than I could've imagined."

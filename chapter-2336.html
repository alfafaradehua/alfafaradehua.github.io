<h1>chapter-2336</h1>

<p>A fragrant aroma immediately surged out of the gash in a frenzy, permeating to every single corner of the plaza in the blink of an eye.

Upon inhaling this scent, everyone was struck by a sense of comfort and reinvigoration.

"The final auction item seems to be a spirit medicine!"

The same thought sprang into everyone's minds, and they immediately focused their attention on the platform.

In contrast with treasures and cultivation arts, spirit medicines were universally useful, and this spirit medicine had been reserved for last, so it had to be something truly incredible.

Hu Yushuang's reached into the gash with a slender hand before pulling out a palm-sized silver bowl, which was the source of the fragrant aroma.

"I'm sure many of you must be very curious about what's in here. Without further ado, let me show you our final auction item," Hu Yushuang said with a smile before tossing the bowl forward, and it hovered in mid-air in front of her as she cast a string of incantation seals toward it.

Dazzling spiritual light erupted out of the bowl, and it suddenly became transparent in appearance, thereby revealing its contents.

The bowl contained some type of clear liquid, within which a shimmering golden five-clawed dragon was swimming around.

The golden dragon was only several inches long, but every single claw, scale, and detail on its body was clearly visible; it was completely identical to a legendary true spirit heavenly dragon.

"That's the descendant of a heavenly dragon? Have you all gone insane? You captured the descendant of a heavenly dragon for your auction?"

"If the true spirits dragon race were to descend upon our Spirit Realm over this matter, the Tian Yuan Continent... no, the entire Spirit Realm would be doomed! This is no laughing matter!"

"I recall hearing about direct descendants of heavenly dragons being stolen in other realms before; all of the smaller realms were completely destroyed by the dragon race, while the larger ones were severely ravages by the revenge of the dragons."

After a brief moment of stunned silence, the entire plaza erupted into a frenzy, and many attendees sprang to their feet while appraising the miniature golden dragon in the bowl with horrified expressions. 

The Grand Ascension Stage beings in the flying cabins were also stunned to see this, but for some reason, they all remained silent.

The situation was beginning to spiral out of control, and Hu Yushuang's brows furrowed slightly upon seeing this.

Right at this moment, one of the trade guild elders seated at a corner of the stone platform suddenly opened his eyes. "Silence!"

His voice wasn't very loud, but it was somehow clearly audible to everyone present, and all those who heard his voice felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over their heads, thereby instantly calming them down.

Only then did they recall that they were still in the trade guild's territory with several Grand Ascension Stage beings overseeing the situation.

All of the attendees immediately sat back down with sheepish expressions, and the commotion quickly died down.

"What's going on here, Fellow Daoist Jia? I'm sure your trade guild wouldn't do something as foolish as abducting the descendant of a heavenly dragon; how do you explain that golden dragon? Don't tell me it has nothing to do with heavenly dragons; we can all clearly sense the true dragon aura that it's releasing," the female Grand Ascension Stage being from the Sky Call race said.

"That's right, this is an extremely important matter, and your trade guild owes us all an explanation," another Grand Ascension Stage being chimed in.

Hu Yushuang's expression changed slightly upon hearing this, and she was just about to say something when the thin trade guild elder held up a hand to stop her.

"What do we need to explain? Take a closer look at that so-called heavenly dragon descendant and you'll know what's going on."

After that, the elder closed his eyes and offered no further explanation.

Thus, all of the attendees in the venue turned their attention toward the miniature golden dragon in the bowl again, inspecting it with both their eyes and their spiritual sense.

Han Li's eyes also narrowed slightly as a hint of blue light flashed within his pupils.

A hint of surprise then appeared on his face as he identified exactly what the golden dragon was.

Aside from Han Li, there were also several other Grand Ascension Stage beings with spirit eyes abilities and other secret techniques that allowed them to glean the nature of the golden dragons, and several cries of surprise rang out almost in unison.

"This golden dragon is formed by a spirit item! This is incredible! How could it possibly possess such a strong true dragon aura?"

"Tsk tsk, I've also identified it to be a manifestation of a spirit item, but I can't tell what its true body is supposed to be. Has anyone figured that out yet?"

"Indeed, a spirit item that can manifest a heavenly dragon definitely be an extraordinary item!"

A spirited discussion immediately ensued between the flying cabins.

"I think I've managed to identify something, but I'm not sure if that's its true form," Han Li said as he stroked his own chin in a contemplative manner.

"Go ahead and tell us what you've seen, Fellow Daoist," a Grand Ascension Stage being urged.

Even though Han Li had secured the inner page of the Golden Jade Tome earlier, he still hadn't revealed the race that he belonged to.

However, he was now proclaiming to have identified the true form of the golden dragon in the bowl, something that no other Grand Ascension Stage being present had been able to achieve, and that naturally attracted a lot of attention.

"If I'm not mistaken, that golden dragon's true form is a drop of spirit blood," Han Li said.

"What? A drop of spirit blood?" 

"But that's impossible! How could a drop of spirit blood take on the form of a heavenly dragon?

"Could it be that this is a drop of heavenly dragon true blood?"

"It can't be; I've seen heavenly dragon true blood in the past, and it definitely wasn't like this."

......

Han Li's words immediately triggered another round of spirited discussion.

As for the foreign beings on the plaza down below, they were also conversing among themselves with perplexed expressions.

A hint of surprise flashed through Hu Yushuang's eyes upon hearing Han Li's verdict, and her change in expression naturally didn't escape Han Li's notice.

A faint smile appeared on his face as he said, "Why are we all playing this guessing game when we could just ask Fellow Daoist Hu to tell us the answer?" 

"That's true, this auction item is being presented by the trade guild, so they must know what it is. Fellow Daoist Hu, stop wasting time and explain to us what this final auction item is."

"I wouldn't dare to waste everyone's time; it's just that I wasn't even given a chance to explain," Hu Yushuang said with a wry smile as she put on a pitiable expression.

"Hehe, now that I think about it, we were indeed a bit too impatient. You can go ahead and talk now."

"Yes, Senior. The senior from before is correct; the true form of this heavenly dragon is indeed just a drop of spirit blood," Hu Yushuang said as bright white light suddenly erupted from her hand, following which she placed her palm down onto the bowl before her.

The liquid within the bowl was shaken slightly, and the fragrant aroma it was giving off immediately became around twice as potent.

At the same time, the miniature golden dragon curled up into a ball before forming a drop of golden liquid.

The drop of liquid was slowly revolving on the spot while giving off a metallic sheen, presenting a mysterious sight to behold.

"Could it be that this really is a drop of heavenly dragon true blood?" someone asked.

"Of course not. Our He Lian Trade Guild has auctioned heavenly dragon true blood in the past, and this is clearly different," Hu Yushuang replied.

"Then what exactly is this?"

"I don't know. All we know is that this is a drop of blood essence, but it's different from the blood essence of all other known powerful beings. Actually, let me rephrase that: none of the powerful beings that we know of can even begin to compare with the owner of this drop of blood essence," Hu Yushuang said.

"Does that include even true spirit heavenly dragons?" someone asked in a stunned voice.

"Of course it does. Truth be told, we've conducted a series of thorough examinations on this drop of spirit blood, and setting aside everything else, the energy contained within this drop of blood essence is over 100 types more potent than what should be found in a drop of heavenly dragon true blood of the same mass; I'm sure all of you are aware of what that entails," Hu Yushuang said with a serious expression.

"Over 100 times more potent? That's impossible! Are you saying the owner of this spirit blood is over 100 times more powerful than a heavenly dragon?" someone immediately exclaimed upon hearing this.

"Even if that isn't the case, it's definitely not far from the truth," Hu Yushuang replied.

"Something that's over 100 times more powerful than a heavenly dragon definitely isn't a living being from our realm; could it be a powerful existence from a higher realm?" the Sky Call being asked in an astonished voice.

She was naturally referring to the True Immortal Realm.

"So this is a drop of blood from a true immortal? But that doesn't explain the heavenly dragon aura that it's releasing," another Grand Ascension Stage mused.

"Have you all forgotten that true dragons exist in the True Immortal Realm as well?" Hu Yushuang asked.

"Are you referring to the ancestral dragons of the True Immortal Realm? Could it be that this is a drop of ancestral dragon blood?" someone else exclaimed.

"We can't verify this, but the appraisal masters of our guild are indeed of this opinion, and this is also one of the reasons why our guild doesn't dare to keep the item and has decided to auction it instead," Hu Yushuang explained.

<p>Chapter 840: A Startling Change



Bright light began to wind around Han Li’s body and his surroundings turned dim and hazy. Countless specks of white light danced around in the air outside.





Han Li clasped his hands in an incantation gesture and spiritual light flowed without end around his body. A whirlwind of light rose from the ground and enveloped him in a gorgeous display.





Soon after, gales began to blow with greater force and frequency as time went by. As for the white light specks in the distance, they were swept inside like moths to the flame. Not long after, the winds formed a huge pillar that reached to the sky, blowing up stones and sand wherever it went as if possessed by a devil.





At that moment, Han Li’s incantation echoed through the fierce winds, causing the pillar of wind to tremble before dispersing. Then, thin glowing clouds floated through the air.





An incantation was quickly spoken and the glowing clouds turned blue. Soon, the sound of rushing water filled the air and countless surging waves rose as far as the eye could see. Waves up to three hundred meters tall began to rise around him. As for Han Li, he was standing within a huge pillar of water and blue light shined from his hands’ incantation gesture, appearing as if he were a water god.





Suddenly, Han Li’s incantation gesture changed and it became muffled.The huge waves disappeared in the blink of an eye as if they were an illusion and were replaced with waves of scarlet flame. Over ten hundred-meter-long fire flood dragons emerged from them, each of them spitting fire from their mouths.





Then, the flames disappeared to be replaced with a verdant sea of trees, an endless desert, a world of ice, and many other worlds as Han Li willed them into existence. For the moment, he appeared to be a godlike existence.





Han Li appeared satisfied with what he had done and then used his magic power to condense a three-kilometer-tall giant. He had it beat its chest before roaring to the sky. Afterwards, silver light began to streak from every corner of the horizon and began to surge towards the giant in a silver wave.





Blinding silver streaks filled the sky and the giant melted underneath the silver lights as if it were ice. But when this light covered Han Li, he felt his eyes burn. He immediately covered his eyes with his hands and miserably scream.





Following, the silver lights in the sky scattered.





Han Li felt completely dazed, but he soon opened his eyes in alarm. The silver light and the world around him had completely disappeared. He was sitting inside a secluded room, his body completely drenched in sweat.





Han Li took a deep breath and calmed himself, finally recalling that he was within a sealed room inside Devilfall Valley. Not long before, he had taken the Nature Origin Pill that he had refined and was enveloped in a world of illusion by the medicinal power erupted from it.





He blankly remained seated and didn’t immediately stand up. As he reflected upon his own experiences in the illusory world, his expression wavered with his face revealing revelation one moment and confusion the next. He then touched his back and found his robes to be drenched.





Han Li bitterly smiled. The Nature Origin Pill was beyond miraculous for it to sink his mind into a world of illusions in spite of his vast spiritual sense.





As for his time inside the illusion, he had become an entirely different person and experienced inconceivable events. He grasped tremendous power with ease, capable of shifting mountains and seas, and calling wind and rain.





But when Han Li recalled what he had done, the incantations became incredibly vague and he couldn’t recall a single word that he spoke, but the grasp and sensation of worldly spiritual power were remembered with complete detail. He felt as if he had experienced it with his body and believed it would prove beneficial for him in breaking through to the next cultivation realm.





Han Li then closed his eyes once more and remained still in place.





Han Li sat in place for half a day before opening his eyes with restored calm. Any trace of confusion had disappeared from his face. He stood up and raised his hand, striking the stone door in front of him with a spell seal. The door flickered with spirit light and slowly opened, allowing Han Li to calmly walk out.





As soon as he walked out, a white streak of light flew out from the stone wall and into his sleeve. It was Silvermoon in her fox form.





Han Li slowly walked towards the cave’s entrance and asked, “How long was I in seclusion? Did anything happen while I was in there?”





Silvermoon replied with a respectful tone, “Master was in seclusion for two days. During this time, Violet Spirit had already emerged, but she saw that the restrictions protecting your cave had yet to be raised and she returned to her residence.”





Han Li indifferently said, “Given her lower cultivation, the Nature Origin PIll should’ve had a lesser effect on her. It is no wonder that she left seclusion earlier. Rather, I am more surprised that you don’t want to take one.”





Silvermoon’s helpless voice left his sleeve, “Master should know that I am quite a bit different from a human cultivator. I am a Silvermoon Wolf that is possessing the body of a demon fox. In addition to medicine pills used to advance cultivation, I don’t dare to negligently take any cultivator medicine pills. Who knows what harm they could cause to me? I would rather just spend more time cultivating than take that risk.”





After a moment of thought, Han Li frowned and nodded , saying nothing further.





Of course, Han Li didn’t waste the remaining Spirit Kindle Fruits. He had consumed them before taking the Nature Origin Pill. With their medicinal power dissolved into his body, he experienced a small but noticeable increase in cultivation. It truly deserved to be a spirit medicine rarely seen in this world.





When Han Li arrived near the exit of the cave residence, he found that his puppets were obediently guarding the gate. He took several steps forward and swept them into his storage pouch in a flash of white light.





At that moment, Han Li opened the stone gate of his cave residence with a magic technique and calmly walked out.





In the instant Han Li walked out, a streak of light shot out from one of the neighboring mountains.





When Han Li saw the light approaching, he calmly waved his hands around him, beckoning all the nearby formation flags and plates that were placed in the ground. They all flew into his hands one after another in streaks of azure light.





“Brother Han, you’ve finally emerged. I believed it would’ve taken you another half day before you came out.”





At that moment, the streak arrived in front of Han Li, revealing Violet Spirit’s figure. She sweetly smiled at Han Li as she floated in the air. Her gorgeous beauty soon unfolded as the light faded away around her face.





Han Li smiled and said, “It seems Violet Spirit has experienced rather fine results after taking the Nature Origin Pill. You are only a few years away from ascending to mid Core Formation stage. Allow me to offer my congratulations ahead of time.”





Violet Spirit’s gaze flickered and she happily said, “Brother Han must be joking. The Nature Origin Pill only saved me several tens of years of bitter cultivation. However, Brother Han now has a good chance of reaching mid Nascent Soul stage after taking the pill. This is worthy of even greater congratulations.”





“Fellow Daoist Violet Spirit can’t believe that the Nature Origin Pill has the same effect on a Core Formation cultivator as a Nascent Soul cultivator,” Han Li calmly said, “Although it was said that the pill is effective to everyone under Deity Transformation stage, the lower the cultivation one possesses, the greater the effect. When Core Formation cultivators take the pill, there is no doubt that they will be able to ascend to the next level, but this isn’t guaranteed for a Nascent Soul cultivator.”





“Regardless of how it is said, the Nature Origin Pill is greatly useful towards ascending to the next level of cultivation. There is no need for Brother Han to be so modest. And give the aptitude Brother Han displayed after reaching Nascent Soul stage in only two hundred years, he should only be a step away from entering mid Nascent Soul stage.”





‘Aptitude?’ When Han Li heard Violet Spirit say this, he couldn’t help but bitterly laugh. Although he didn’t correct her, he did shake his head in silence.





Violet Spirit pursed her lips in a smile and thought to say something more when a huge rumble sounded out in the distance. It appeared as if a fierce tremble shook the entire world. Han Li handled it well enough, but Violet Spirit was shaken by this and fell from the air.





She hastily stopped her fall with a burst of light and shouted out in alarm, “What happened? What is going on?”





Also shocked, Han Li didn’t answer and turned his head in the direction of the source of this sound.





“Yi! That is the area that the map indicated.” Han Li’s heart stirred and he felt somewhat bewildered.





At that moment, a white line howled as it streaked from the horizon, carrying booms in its wake. In the blink of an eye, the white light turned thicker and countless waves of white Qi suddenly appeared nearby.





As far as the eye could see, a boundless and unimaginable tall wave of white Qi engulfed the surrounding mountains as it made its way towards Han Li and Violet Spirit. In the blink of an eye, it was only about a kilometer away from them.





“Not good!” When Han Li saw this, his expression changed and he summoned a small blue shield with a shake of his sleeve. It revolved around him once and expanded into a huge shield in front of him.





He pointed at the huge shield and a layer of blue light emitted from it, enveloping Han Li within it. Still feeling unease, he spat out a ball of blue icy flame and had it rupture thirty meters in front of him.





The blue flame radiantly glowed and crackled. The large icy ball of Qi rapidly expanded and in the blink of an eye, a twenty-meter-tall ice mountain appeared in front of Han Li.





As for Violet Spirit, she also reacted with alarm and released an embroidered scarf that release a mist of light to protect her. When she saw that Han Li had condensed an ice mountain, she hastily flew to his side with delight. At that moment, the rushing wave of Qi had finally arrived before them.





The entire sky grew dim. Soon, the violent sounds of shattering earth burst around them. A huge tremble resonated from the ice mountain ahead of them where tens of boulders smashed into it, each impact releasing a sharp clank. The sound was discomforting and made one’s heart stir.

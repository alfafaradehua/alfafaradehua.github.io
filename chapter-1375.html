<p>Chapter 1375: Black Leaves Forest

At first glance, the two huge beasts appeared to be giant apes. But their green fur was exceptionally long and they had three black eyes. They were continuously flickering around out of vigilance.

Han Li calmly observed them as they walked past. After they were farther away, he blurred and arrived at a distant tree.

When he watched them disappear, a trace of bewilderment appeared on his face.

The two patrolling beasts weren't wood tribe beings. Why would they appear in the forest? They were intelligent as they were carrying huge copper prongs.

Could it be another unknown tribe?

After some thought, Han Li couldn't help but shake his head.

According to what he knew, the wood tribe was extremely xenophobic. They wouldn't allow other foreign tribes to boldly strut in their territory. Could it be beasts of war bred by the wood tribe? Han Li thought.

So-called beasts of war were spirit beasts of another name. Like humans and demons, through secret techniques these foreign tribes were able to control spirit beasts. Other foreign tribes understood they could put ancient beasts to their own devices after training them with medicine or anything else.

Of course, various races had differing talents. The beasts they could train and control differed.  Not all of them could tame the same beasts.

The shadow tribe's two-headed Shen Beast was a powerful war beast exclusive to their tribe. He also reckoned only the shadow tribe had a method of taming it.

As for the wood tribe, he wasn't aware that they had any war beasts. Could this be a new development?

Han Li held curious thoughts for half a day before eventually putting the matter away.

Since the two beasts with long green fur passed him by without discovering him, he reckoned, they would be the kind to have thick flesh and skin. He had nothing to fear.

As a result, Han Li's body blurred and he vanished.

...

A day later, below a huge tree in the forest, Han Li was sullenly looking at eight long-furred beasts in front of him.

They were different from the two ape-like beasts he had seen before. Not only were their bodies smaller by half, but their bodies were fire-red and their furred hands carried sparkling black wolf fangs, not copper prongs.

These eight huge beasts were all glaring at Han Li with bared fangs.

Han Li smirked.

Originally, he believed the beasts to have extremely dim spiritual senses. But when the pack of beasts brushed past him, they discovered him hiding behind a tree and immediately surrounded him.

Han Li looked at the black-lit third eye on the beasts' forehead and frowned. He faintly sensed something.

When he saw those green-haired beasts, their third eye was closed.

At that moment, the eight red beasts let out a roar and leaped at him. They fiercely waved their fangs.

Their fangs immediately lit up in a layer of green light released fierce winds in Han Li's direction.

Han Li raised his brow but showed no intention of blocking them. He simply waved his sleeve.

Eight small golden swords appeared and they blurred, quickly coiling around each of the beasts.

Pfff. Their heads rolled off like cabbages.

When the eight swords trembled and returned to Han Li, the corpses were already pooling their green blood on the ground.

Han Li waved his other sleeve at the corpses and released fireballs upon each of the corpses.

In a few crackles, the bodies immediately turned to ash.

With that done, Han Li expressionlessly blurred and he left a string of afterimages as he headed deeper into the forest.

But not long after he left, two green streaks appeared on a huge tree near what had happened. They were two foot-long green eyes. The green eyes emotionlessly looked around and stared in the direction that Han Li disappeared.

In an area myriad of kilometers away, under the concealment of other unremarkable trees, another pair of green eyes opened.

The pair of green eyes silently stared at the air three hundred meters away. A man and a woman were standing shoulder to shoulder. The man wore green robes while the woman wore black robes. They were Long Dong and Xiao Hong.

The two were communicating something through voice transmission. On the ground near them, there were a dozen green and red-furred beasts.

"Brother Long, those creatures seem weak, but they can see through our concealment techniques. My Illusion Haze Flag is supposed to conceal me even from similar grade cultivators." Xiao Hong said through voice transmission.

With a trace of bewilderment on his face, Long Dong replied, "It should have something to do with their third eye. Beasts that are born with multiple eyes tend to carry particular abilities. In that case, we should be careful."

"That is most likely it. Let's go. We need to catch up with that girl. Otherwise, it'll fall into her hands." She said with a sullen face.

Long Dong strangely smiled and eerily said, "Hehe! I didn't expect you and that girl to take on this assignment with a secret plan. It is a pity the item has little value to our Long Clan. However, Fairy should forget about our previous agreement. The item goes to you, but she goes to me."

Xiao Hong snorted and said, "Although I am also interested in her Heavenly Phoenix Blood, the item is significant in the eyes of the clan. I know what is more important."

"Hehe, that's good. Let's go!" Long Dong chuckled.

After the two blurred, they disappeared.

Off in another direction, a strange white image was quickly shooting past the forest floor. It was travelling at unbelievable speeds.

...

The Black Leaves Forest was a secretive place with many layers of restrictions. Under a silver tree that paled in size to the rest of the rest, several dark figures were sitting cross-legged. One of them suddenly opened their eyes, revealing dark green eyes that shined with golden light. It let out short strange cries.

The other figures opened their eyes as well. Among them was a figure that was far taller than the others. It let out a dignified tone as if it were asking something.

The figure that first screeched immediately crouched down and began to respectfully. answer.

With that done, the towering figure uttered a string of commands.

The others immediately rose and surrounded the small tree.

The towering figure let out a roar and pointed at the small tree next to him. A green light suddenly shot out and entered the tree.

Suddenly, the silver tree trembled and several silver eyes opened from it. At the same time, it released several bowl-sized silver beams of light, striking each of the figures.

When the beams of light struck them, their bodies grew vague and they disappeared.

...

Han Li naturally was unaware of what was happening in other parts of the forest. He was stealthily traveling.

His path forward became extraordinarily smooth. Apart from occasionally encountering long-furred beasts, he didn't see anything else, wood tribe beings included.

While this was cause for joy, Han Li couldn't help but feel somewhat suspicious.

But after a brief thought, he believed this to be nothing out of the ordinary, given the grand size of the forest.

And as the assignment was the key to his much needed Earth Cleansing Pills, he couldn't abandon the mission now that he was this deep into the forest.

So even with a trace of unease in his mind, Han Li continued forward with a somewhat cautious attitude.

...

Two days later, Han Li stopped on top of a thin tree branch. His body seemed to weigh nothing more than a calm wind. He looked at a three hundred meter tall hill not far away.

There were sparsely any trees or vegetation on the hill. All the trees were ancient as well.

Han Li stared at the hill for a long while before flipping his hand, summoning pitch-black triangular spell disc.

The heart of the spell plate flickered with white light.

He lowered his head to look at the plate for a moment and then looked at the hill in the distance. He then struck the plate with an azure spell seal.

Black light suddenly lit up from it and a white light speck flew out and circled the plate. It released a thin white thread, pointing at an ancient tree on the hill.

Han Li's eyes stirred.

The ancient tree indicated was half shriveled. It was over a hundred meters tall and its surface was scorched black as if it were struck by lightning. The bottom half of the tree was yellow and its roots were green.

Han Li looked at it for a moment and narrowed his eyes. He slowly released his spiritual sense and examined his surroundings.

A short while later, he opened his eyes and wore a trace of relief.

He was alone.

Han Li didn't immediately set off. He narrowed his eyes in thought, deciding to wave his sleeve first. He summoned several balls that shimmered silver and opened his mouth to spit out fist-sized silver firebirds.

The birds circled his body and turned a foot long. They flew into his palm and consumed each of the silver beads. Then in the flash, they burrowed into the ground.

With that done, Han Li swept his hand over his storage bracelet, producing a set of azure spell flags. He wordlessly tossed them in front of him.

Eight green streaks shot out and disappeared all around the hill.

Han Lie continued, forming a hand gesture and softly uttering an incantation.

A layer of green light surrounded the hill, but soon, Han Li commanded it with a spell seal, and it turned invisible with a few flashes.

When Han Li saw this, he sighed and he leaped off. Blurring several times before arriving at the edge of the hill.

In a green flash, he disappeared.

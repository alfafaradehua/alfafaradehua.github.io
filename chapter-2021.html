<h1>chapter-2021</h1>

<p>After just a few flashes, Han Li and the others finally reached the  giant black light barrier up ahead, where they were stopped in their  tracks. The long-haired man from the Lin Family immediately made a  grabbing motion, conjuring up a huge azure claw that attacked the light  barrier with devastating force.

A resounding boom rang out as the light barrier flashed erratically a few times, but it remained completely unscathed.

The  long-haired man's expression changed slightly, and he gave a cold  harrumph before preparing to unleash another attack, but right at this  moment, the elderly scholar of the Spirit Race stepped in, sweeping a  sleeve through the air to release seven or eight talismans of different  colors that vanished into the light barrier in a flash.

In the  next instant, a rumbling boom rang out from the light barrier, and it  tremored violently before shattering to open up a massive hole.

The long-haired man's heart stirred upon seeing this, and he turned to the elderly scholar with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

It  seemed that Holy Maiden Thousand Autumns hadn't been exaggerating, this  elderly scholar really was a master in the art of restrictions and  formations.

The other human cultivators were also rather taken  aback, but there wasn't any time for them to ponder such a matter in  this situation. Thus, all of them shot forth through the hole as streaks  of light, and only then did the hole on the black light barrier seal  shut again.

However, during this brief delay, the devilish guards patrolling the nearby area had already surrounded them.

Han  Li and the others immediately combined as one to form a streak of  rainbow light that was over 1,000 feet in length, then flew toward a  certain direction. The devilish guards in that direction were very  alarmed to see this, but the streak of light was far too fast for them  to evade, and they were instantly incinerated into ashes.

The  other devilish beings converging toward the scene all stopped  involuntarily upon seeing this, and the streak of rainbow light tore  through seven layers of restrictions with unstoppable force.

However,  just as it was about to plunge into the dark cloud above the devilish  stronghold, a roar of fury suddenly rang out alongside a rumbling  thunderclap.

Thick bolts of lightning sprang out of the cloud  like silver pythons, intertwining to form a massive lightning net that  crashed down toward everyone.

If a normal Body Integration  cultivator were facing such a fearsome restriction, they'd most likely  be forced to take evasive measures. However, there were as many as four  late-Body Integration Stage beings in Han Li's group, and everyone else  was also at the Body Integration Stage, so they certainly weren't going  to fear this lightning net.

The Long Family patriarch harrumphed coldly, "What a pathetic little trick!"

He  raised a hand as he spoke to release a small silver vial, which swelled  to around a foot in size as soon as it hurled through the air. 

A  burst of white Qi surged out of the opening of the vial, and it  transformed into countless threads of light that swept upward in unison.

A peculiar turn of events immediately unfolded!

As  soon as the lightning net came into contact with the threads of light,  it was drawn toward the small vial, and in the blink of an eye, the  entire lightning net had been drawn into the small vial.

"That's  the Lightningcleanse Vial! You're from the Long Family!" the devilish  being within the dark cloud exclaimed in a horrified voice.

"Oh?  You recognize this treasure from our Long Family? You must be a  devilish lord then. Fellow daoists, let's continue onward," the Long  Family patriarch said in a nonchalant voice as he stowed the small vial  back up his sleeve.

Han Li and the others naturally had no  objections to this, and they plunged into the dark cloud as a collective  streak of rainbow light. 

There were still some other  restrictions within the dark cloud, but all of them were destroyed with  ease, and after just a few flashes, the streak of rainbow light reached  the shimmering grey node.

However, situated in front of the  node were hundreds of elite devilish beings with a huge devilish figure  behind them. The devilish figure had black Qi all around its body,  thereby concealing its appearance, but its large shimmering eyes were  still visible, and there was clearly an incredulous look within them. 

"Hmph,  so it really is a devilish lord," Holy Maiden Thousand Autumns  harrumphed coldly with furrowed brows at the sight of the devilish  figure.

"One devilish lord isn't going to be able to stop us.  If it dares to attack us, then it'll simply be asking to be killed.  There's no need to pay any heed to it; our priority is to get to the  node as quickly as possible," the Holy Spirit enshrouded within white  light chuckled coldly.

Holy Maiden Thousand Autumns nodded in response before flying ahead, followed by the other Holy Spirits.

"Now's  not the time to be getting caught up in battles; as long as that  devilish lord doesn't attack us, we won't attack it, either," the Long  Family patriarch said in a cold voice before also flying toward the node  as a streak of golden light, and Han Li and the others naturally  followed along.

The devilish lord's face immediately paled at  the sight of the oncoming Body Integration Stage powerful beings, and  after grappling with an internal conflict for a long while, he gritted  his teeth in the end and commanded his subordinates to step aside.

The Holy Spirit enshrouded within white light was the first to enter the node, and he vanished amid a rumbling boom.

Han Li and the others also flew in behind him without any hesitation.

A burst of powerful spatial fluctuations erupted out of the node before it reverted back to its original peaceful state.

The  devilish lord appraised the node with a dark expression for a long  while, and one of his subordinates approached him with an uneasy look on  his face. "Those foreign powerful beings definitely aren't harboring  good intentions; should we give chase?"

"Hmph, give chase?  What if they're waiting for us on the other side? We'll be charging to  our deaths!" the devilish lord snapped.

The mid-grade devilish  being who had raised the question immediately shuddered and backed away  after without daring to say anything further.

Right at this  moment, a long cry rang out from within the dark cloud, following which a  gust of green devilish wind swept forth, then stopped not far away from  the devilish lord before revealing a thin and tall green humanoid  figure.

This was a middle-aged man with a pair of wings on his back.

"Where  are all the foreign cultivators, Brother Ke?" the winged man asked in  an urgent manner after frantically casting his gaze through the  surrounding area.

"You came too late, Brother Feng; they've already entered the node," the massive devilish figure replied in a grim voice.

The  winged man's expression changed drastically upon hearing this. "What?  Why didn't you stop them? If the Sacred Ancestors hear of this, we'll be  severely punished!"

"Stop them? That was a group of 10  beings, all of whom were at the Body Integration Stage; there were even  several late-Body Integration Stage beings among them. If they weren't  in a hurry to enter the node, I would've already been killed!" the first  devilish lord replied in a cold voice.

"What? They were all at the Body Integration Stage? Are you serious?" the winged man exclaimed in astonishment.

"Everyone  else saw them as well. Do you think I'd let them through so easily  otherwise?" the devilish lord sighed in a resigned manner.

The  winged man turned toward the other devilish beings present, and they  all confirmed what the devilish lord had proclaimed. After a long while,  he finally recovered from his astonishment, and said, "This is a very  important matter; we have to report it to the Sacred Ancestors."

A  peculiar light flashed through the devilish lord's eyes upon hearing  this, yet just as he was about to reply, an indifferent female voice  suddenly rang out. "Don't report this matter to anyone."

"Who's there?"

Both  the huge devilish figure and the winged man were quite started by this  voice, and they immediately approached one another with their backs  facing each other. One of them summoned a pair of silver longswords  while the other conjured up a long black spear, and they both adopted  cautious expressions.

They knew that someone who could hide  from them at such close quarters had to possess powers superior to  theirs, so they naturally became very wary.

Right at this  moment, a peculiar fragrance wafted through the air, following which a  giant floral tree appeared up above without any warning amid a burst of  spatial fluctuations.

The floral tree was glittering and translucent with beautiful fist-sized pink flowers growing all over its branches.

"It's the Brilliant Treasured Sacred Flower!"

The  winged man's face immediately became twisted with horror at the sight  of the floral tree, and he immediately flapped his wings to flee into  the distance. 

However, right at this moment, the pink flowers  on the tree suddenly burst into flames, and its petals drifted down  from above as balls of pink fire.

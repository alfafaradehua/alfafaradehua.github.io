<p>Chapter 545: Thunderstorm Wings

The Venomous Flood Dragon pulverised the large, shiny pearl that it had originally been playing with in its hand and glanced at Han Li with a malicious glint flickering within his eyes. "Humph! Humans are all so cunning and sly. I don't care where you've seen me before, but you had better cut the clever business!"

Han Li's heart slightly shivered, but apart from a bitter chuckle, he said nothing else.

Seeing that the atmosphere wasn't to his liking, Feng Xi hastily interjected himself, "Enough. Fellow Daoist Li can now be considered to be acquainted with you little brothers. I wish to draw from the support of all three of you, and It would be quite troublesome if I were to lack any of you." He then directed Han Li to a seat that was farther away from those two.

The Venomous Flood Dragon downed the wine in the cup in front of him and carelessly said, "Brother Feng, we've known each other for quite a few years already. Why are you treating this matter so mysteriously? You've yet to give us an explanation. Additionally, you require the assistance of a human cultivator, and a trifling Core Formation cultivator at that."

"That's right. I am also quite curious. You insisted for us two to come together. Could it be that Brother Feng is doing something dangerous?" The demon tortoise with a thick shell on its back frowned. He may possess an extremely large body, but he appeared rathered timid.

Feng Xi smiled and slightly spread out his arms. "There is no need to worry, Fellow Daoist Gui. I didn't call you two over to deal with a formidable enemy, or to travel to a dangerous area. Rather, I wish for your assistance in refining a magic treasure."

"Refining a magic treasure?" The tortoise and flood dragon paused for a moment before glancing at one another. A trace of amazement also appeared on Han Li's face.

Feng Xi slowly said with a feverish expression, "That's right, I am preparing to refine a magic treasure to fit onto my own body."

"Did we hear correctly? Brother Feng wishes to refine a magic treasure? Don't tell me you've forgotten that the bodies of us demon cultivators are better than any magic treasure. What material could possibly be refined to be stronger than one's own body?" The Venomous Flood Dragon shook his head in disapproval.

The demon tortoise nodded his head in agreement and said, "Brother Wu's words are undoubtedly true. The might of any magic treasure will undoubtedly be inferior to the innate bodies of us demon cultivators. Rather than wasting time on external items, wouldn't it be better to further cultivate one's own abilities? For example, with regards to Brother Wu's flood dragon constitution, his innate water-attribute techniques have become a hundred times stronger than other races with only slight cultivation. With your spirit aviary constitution, you should have exceptionally good aptitude towards wind attribute techniques. By cultivating your Firestorm Wings to a deeper stage, you should be able to travel tens of thousands of miles in an instant and roam the seas as you please. As for my profound tortoise constitution, although it isn't as remarkable as either of yours, my shell will become invulnerable when it is cultivated to the sentient transformation stage. How could a human refined magic treasure possibly compare?"

Feng Xi didn't grow angry at their words. Rather, he wore a relaxed smile and said, "Given how long I've cultivated, how could I not know this? However, the magic treasure I wish to refine is profound. It is a pair of spiritual wings. With these Thunderstorm Wings, I am confident I will be able to roam the skies without limits!"

"Thunderstorm Wings!" The demon tortoise absently blinked. It seemed he was at a loss.

"That's right. A few years ago, when I toured the deep seas for cultivation, I came upon an ancient cultivator's ruins, and discovered the remains of a huge bird. Although only its silver wing bones remained, they still possessed an astonishing amount of lightning energy. I suspect the wing bones belonged to of a peak metamorphosis stage Lightning Roc. You should know that the Lightning Rock is a primordial bird that possessed extreme speed. It could be considered among the top ten of high-grade, bird-type demon beasts. It's speed was similar to a flash of lightning, far superior to that of a Windbreaker Beast. Thus, I was struck with a sudden inspiration of bringing the bones back to my cave dwelling and using them along with other bird wing materials to create a human-like magic treasure and affix it to my body." Feng Xi's eyes glistened as if he was unable to contain the excitement in his heart.

He then added, "After refining the wing bones, they naturally can't be solely lightning attribute. A bit of wind attribute spiritual power must be added as well so that I may use them more easily."

"Is that even possible?" The Venomous Flood Dragon revealed a doubtful expression. The demon tortoise at his side also appeared skeptical.

"Don't worry. I've already spent a year researching the wing. I even went as far as to change my appearance and headed over to the humans for their tool refining texts and instruction. Afterwards, I combined them with my Firestorm Wing refinement methods to come up with the current plans to refine a magic treasure. While I don't dare to say that success is certain, the odds are at least eighty percent. Of course, you won't be helping me for nothing. Regardless of whether the magic treasure succeeds..." The Windbreaker Beast spoke confidently. He started speaking in voice transmission, not wishing for Han Li to hear what he said regarding their compensation.

Han Li sat calmly at the side, turning a blind eye to what was happening. However, he had placed both of his hands on the table unconsciously revealing his annoyance, contrary to his calm expression.

Han Li knew that the three demons' conditions were unfavorable to him. However, he had no rights to be asking questions in their presence. He could only stifle his curiosity and think of his own countermeasures in silence.

After discussing it with the demon tortoise, the flood dragon eventually agreed, "Good, since Brother Feng mentioned those conditions, we will definitely provide our assistance."

Feng Xi was delighted to hear that and confidently smiled, "With your earth attribute techniques you'll be able to use your formation spells to temporarily create lightning attribute spiritual power. I'll be able to combine wind spiritual power into it with my own wind attribute techniques. But in order to balance both powers, we'll require Fellow Daoist Li's wood attribute cultivation arts to counteract any disparities in power from either side. With this, the wind and thunder will hopefully be able to succeed!"

When his gaze fell upon Han Li and saw that he was sitting there without a word, he suddenly thought of something. A strange expression suddenly flickered within his eyes and he gave Han Li a beaming smile, "Fellow Daoist Li, I forgot to tell you. Although the Jadefire Wine can assist in a human's cultivation, the wine was something that was prepared for the consumption of demon cultivators after all. As a result, human cultivators will experience a trace of chaotic malicious Qi. Although there is nothing wrong now, soon enough, the malicious Qi will spread and mix with one's true essence, resulting in a detonation of one's spiritual power."

After he said that, Feng Xi immediately closed his mouth and coldly stared at Han Li in silence. Han Li merely sighed with a frown, displaying neither panic nor fury.

Han Li slowly asked with a tranquil expression, "If Brother Feng can help me eliminate this malicious Qi, then please speak. Will I only be able to survive if the magic treasure refinement succeeds?"

This caused a trace of surprise to momentarily appear in Feng Xi's eyes. The other two demon beasts also revealed an interested expression upon hearing Han Li.

"Hehe, Fellow Daoist Li is a sensible person. Since you already know this, I won't further speak of it. So long as the Thunderstorm Wings are successfully refined, I will remove this future ailment. But if it fails, you will be the first target of my frustrations. You had best dissolve any fantasies of dissolving it on your own. Even if Nascent Soul cultivators were willing to assist you, They wouldn't be able to eliminate the chaotic malicious Qi leftover from the Jadefire Wine." He spoke with a chilling voice and displayed not the slightest emotion.

"I know what must be done!" Han Li nodded his head but bitterly smiled in his heart. He also refrained from saying anything in his mind, fearing that it would somehow affect his later performance during the magic treasure refinement.

As Han Li was brimming with the feeling of helplessness, the three demon cultivators were having a leisurely chat at the table.

Feeling that the odds of success with the refinement was high, Feng Xi cheerfully asked the flood dragon, "I heard that Little Brother Wu's flood dragon clan has partaken in the Unfathomable Depth's assault on human cultivators. Is this matter true? I've always recalled that flood dragons hadn't bothered themselves with these matters."

"Humph! That's right. This time, there are a few experts from our clans that have decided to act. How else could the rubbish from the Unfathomable Depths possibly have succeeded in their attack? Were it not for our assistance, they wouldn't have been able to exterminate the two Nascent Soul cultivators." The flood dragon didn't bother to conceal the matter in the presence of Han Li.

Although no clear emotion appeared on Han Li's face, he couldn't help but reveal some surprise.

<p>"I see, you must be related to one of the devilish beings I killed earlier, right? Only a bloodline secret technique like this one would have planted a tracking mark on me without my detection. However, your mental state was a little too unstable, and that allowed me to notice your bloodline mark. Otherwise, I may not have been able to detect your presence," Han Li said with a smile as he swept a sleeve through the air, releasing a silver fireball that incinerated the ball of azure Qi into nothingness.

"At your cultivation base, you must be quite an important figure in the Elder Devil Race, right? Tell us your name," Fairy Silver Light said as a hint of killing intent flashed through her eyes.

"Hmph, I am Lord Li, a subordinate to Sacred Ancestor Xue Guang. You killed my grandson, so I'm going to tear you into shreds and torture your soul until it disintegrates!" Instead of displaying any fear toward the two Body Integration cultivators he had encountered, Lord Li was glowering at Han Li with fury burning in his eyes instead.

"Is that so? Let's see if you have what it takes," Han Li chuckled in a nonchalant manner.

At his current cultivation base, a mere early-Body Integration Stage devilish being really wasn't all that threatening to him.

"You think you can take on both of us on your own? There's no need to waste time with words here, Brother Han; this devilish lord is ripe for the killing," Fairy Silver Light said in a frosty voice, following which the two silver hooks before her transformed into countless silver hook projections that surged forth in a massive wave.

A faint smile appeared on Han Li's words upon seeing this. Fairy Silver Light had said exactly what he was thinking, and he raised a hand to wave the silver ruler through the air again.

Piercing silver light flashed, and a ruler projection that was several hundred feet in length shot forth again, reaching the elderly man in the blink of an eye before crashing down with devastating force.

Lord Li let loose a low roar upon seeing this and abruptly swept his black staff through the air, conjuring up countless black staff projections that formed an impenetrable barrier around himself.

The silver ruler projection was repelled by this barrier, then crumbled away under the effect of some kind of peculiar power, completely unable to breach the elderly man's defenses.

At this moment, the countless hook projections also arrived, but all of them quickly vanished amid flashes of silver light upon coming into contact with the barrier of staff projections.

In the end, the two silver hooks were forced to revert back to their original form, and Fairy Silver Light's expression darkened slightly upon seeing this.

She immediately switched to a different hand seal, and the two silver hooks suddenly rose up into the air as two streaks of silver light before vanishing on the spot.

In the next instant, violent fluctuations ran through the entire sky, and all of the world's origin Qi within a radius of several tens of kilometers was swept up. Countless red and white runes instantly surged out of thin air, then converged to form two gargantuan balls of light, one white and one red, each of which was around an acre in size.

The ball of white light was completely silent, while the ball of red light was rumbling incessantly, and they both came crashing down from above.

Lord Li was quite alarmed by the sight of these two devastating balls of light, and he swept his staff through the air again, upon which it abruptly transformed into a gust of fierce black wind that swept toward the two balls of light in a frenzy, looking as if he were planning to forcibly tear through them.

However, right at this moment, Han Li suddenly rubbed his hands together, and the silver ruler in his grasp abruptly vanished without any premonition.

In the next instant, faint silver light flashed behind Lord Li, and the silver ruler emerged silently before hurtling through the air like a bolt of silver lightning.

Lord Li was completely caught off guard, his body was instantly enveloped by several layers of silver light. He let loose a roar of fury as black light erupted from his body in an attempt to break through the layers of silver light, but he was clearly unable to accomplish this in a short time.

At this moment, the fierce gust of black wind formed by the staff clashed with the balls of light up above, and an earth-shattering boom rang out, causing the entire sky to tremor incessantly.

The black wind then suddenly transformed into a pair of identical gargantuan pillars that plunged viciously into the two balls of light.

The balls of light dissipated, but a pristine crescent moon and a scorching crimson sun emerged from within them.

The two were radiating dazzling light, and they had temporarily trapped the two giant pillars that had been thrust into them.

Lord Li was tugging violently on the pillars with his powerful arms, but they refused to budge; it was as if they had taken root in the moon and the sun.

A cold smile appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and he pointed a finger at Lord Li.

The layers of silver light around him immediately began to emit a loud buzzing sound, and a series of silver runes of different sizes emerged, producing a burst of enormous force that compressed violently toward Lord Li, instantly crushing most of the protective black light around his body in the process.

The elderly man was clearly quite reluctant to abandon the treasures in his hands, but he was forced to release the two giant pillars. A vicious light then flashed through his eyes as he quickly made a hand seal before letting loose a loud cry.

An astonishing scene then ensued.

His massive body suddenly began to swell drastically once again, and two balls of flesh bulged from his shoulders. Following a string of harrowing cracks and pops, two more identical heads emerged on his shoulders.

At the same time, four more balls of flesh bulged out of his back, and they transformed into two pairs of arms amid a flash of black light.

The elderly man had transformed into a devilish being with three heads and six arms in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, there was violent black devilish Qi erupting from his body, and his aura had swelled to become more than twice as powerful as it had originally been. As such, his early-Body Integration Stage powers rose to around the mid-Body Integration Stage.

After making this transformation, a vicious look appeared on all three of Lord Li's faces. He flipped his six hands over, and six black devilish swords emerged, then unleashed countless black threads that erupted forth like a giant net.

The layers of silver light around him were instantly sliced into countless pieces, and Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this as he immediately waved a hand through the air.

The shattered fragments of the silver light began to converge and regenerate, but during this split-second delay, Lord Li's body flashed, and he vanished on the spot.

In the next instant, spatial fluctuations erupted several hundred feet away, and Lord Li re-emerged.

As soon as he appeared, he let loose a thunderous roar, and a series of black devilish patterns appeared over his body. Immediately thereafter, he expanded even further to over 1,000 feet in size, then swept his six arms through the air. The six giant swords that he was wielding vanished amid a flash of black light, but his gigantic hands reached out like three pairs of small mountains, with two of them reaching for the moon and the sun, while two more reached out for Han Li and Fairy Silver Light.

Meanwhile, his remaining two hands were rapidly making a series of hand seals. At the same time, the two heads on his shoulders closed their eyes, then began to chant something as black runes swirled around them. 

The sun and the moon formed by the silver hooks were quite profound, but in the face of Lord Li, who had become drastically more powerful, they were no longer able to continue locking the pair of giant black staves in place. Thus, the two staves shot forth through the air before landing in Lord Li's grasp, following which the two combined as one and reverted back to a single giant black staff.

Almost in the exact same instant, Han Li felt the sky dim before his eyes, and a giant black palm reached him in a flash.

Han Li remained completely calm and collected as golden light revolved around his body. He extended a palm out of his sleeve, which transformed into a giant golden hand that reached out through the air.

Prior to even coming into contact with one another, countless golden arcs of lightning erupted from the golden hand, and it crashed violently into the massive black palm.

A resounding thunderclap rang out, and the devilish hand was instantly vanquished as if those arcs of golden lightning were the bane of its existence.

In contrast, Fairy Silver Light didn't dare to take the attack head-on. In the instant that the devilish hand was about to reach her, she transformed into a gentle breeze that vanished on the spot, leaving the devilish hand to strike nothing but empty air.

Lord Li's expression darkened even further after witnessing his attacks being nullified, and his other two heads suddenly ceased their chanting. The two hands that were making hand seals just a moment ago abruptly reached out to point at Han Li and Fairy Silver Light.

Two sharp ringing sounds rang out from his fingertips, and a pair of crimson threads shot forth before vanishing into thin air in a flash.

A solemn look appeared on Han Li's face upon seeing this, and he suddenly raised a hand, upon which a small black mountain appeared before him. The mountain was around 70 to 80 feet tall, and it hovered before him like a massive shield.

This was none other than the Extreme Essencefused Mountain!

In the next instant, the crimson thread reappeared several tens of feet away before plunging viciously into the small black mountain. Crimson light flashed, and the thread managed to pierce several feet into the mountain before it finally dissipated.

Han Li's expression changed slightly upon seeing this. No one was more aware than him of just how incredible the Extreme Essencefused Mountain's defensive prowess was. The treasure had been infused with countless precious materials and refined on several occasions; even the average Divine Spirit Treasure wouldn't be able to leave so much as a scratch on its surface. As such, the fact that the crimson thread was able to plunge so far into it was a testament to just how fearsome it was.

It was no wonder that even after his transformation, it had taken Lord Li so long to prepare that attack.

The attack didn't pose much of a threat to him, but Fairy Silver Light would most likely struggle to handle it.

Just as Han Li was thinking this, he heard a muffled groan, and he hurriedly cast his gaze toward Fairy Silver Light to find that she was stumbling back a few steps with a hand clasped over her own shoulder.

There was a red shield, a flag, and a jade badge hovering in front of her, but the spiritual light radiating from them had dimmed significantly, and it seemed that they had all been severely damaged.
